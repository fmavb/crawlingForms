</p>
<p class="popup-content">You’ll also get sufficient time with a doctor and not feel rushed so you can properly discuss your health concerns or illness.  The amount of time you need with the doctor will depend on how many concerns of illnesses you need to discuss and the complexity.  Please refer to the ‘how long do I need’ link for further information.
</p>
<p class="popup-content">Our doctors offer a range of services, from advice on minor illnesses to women and men’s health. If you require further investigations we can organise blood tests or scans at an additional cost. Private consultant referrals and private prescription notes are supplied at no extra cost.</p>
<p>Please be aware that our service cannot provide all the services available from your NHS doctor. In particular we are unable to  manage acute medical, surgical and psychiatric emergencies including treating cuts and wounds, prescribe controlled drugs including tranquillisers and night sedation, or initiate anti-depressant medication, ear wax syringing and sexual health screening.

<h2>COVID-19 Rapid Antibody test</h2>
<p><b>Please note this is not a COVID-19 PCR or Antigen test to tell you if you are currently infected. This test cannot be used for travel requirements.</b></p>
<p>This is a 15-minute appointment, it involves one of our Health Advisors taking a blood sample from a small finger prick to test for detectable antibodies to Covid-19 (coronavirus). The presence of antibodies tells you whether you have <b>previously</b> been infected with Covid-19. </p>
<p>In response to infection with Covid-19, most people will produce antibodies in the blood. These take some time to develop in response to the infection. If you have had symptoms of Covid-19 (new cough, fever, or flu-like symptoms) this test should be completed a minimum of 20 days after the symptoms began. It is important to note that a negative test does not completely rule out a previous infection just that antibodies can’t be detected. </p>
<p>This test may also be appropriate for individuals who may not have developed any symptoms of Covid-19, but are interested in whether they have previously been infected.</p>
<p>Please note, that the presence of antibodies in your blood (a positive result) does <b>not</b> mean that you are protected from catching coronavirus again or passing it onto others.  As such you should continue to follow the current government guidelines around social distancing and self-isolation, regardless of your result. </p>

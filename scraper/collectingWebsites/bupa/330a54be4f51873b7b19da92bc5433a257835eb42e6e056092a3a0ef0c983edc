<h2>COVID-19 Rapid Antibody test</h2>
<p><b>Please note this is not a COVID-19 PCR or Antigen test to tell you if you are currently infected. This test cannot be used for travel requirements.</b></p>
<p>This is a 15-minute appointment, it involves one of our Health Advisors taking a blood sample from a small finger prick to test for detectable antibodies to Covid-19 (coronavirus). The presence of antibodies tells you whether you have <b>previously</b> been infected with Covid-19. </p>
<p>In response to infection with Covid-19, most people will produce antibodies in the blood. These take some time to develop in response to the infection. If you have had symptoms of Covid-19 (new cough, fever, or flu-like symptoms) this test should be completed a minimum of 20 days after the symptoms began. It is important to note that a negative test does not completely rule out a previous infection just that antibodies canâ€™t be detected. </p>
<p>This test may also be appropriate for individuals who may not have developed any symptoms of Covid-19, but are interested in whether they have previously been infected.</p>
<p>Please note, that the presence of antibodies in your blood (a positive result) does <b>not</b> mean that you are protected from catching coronavirus again or passing it onto others.  As such you should continue to follow the current government guidelines around social distancing and self-isolation, regardless of your result. </p>

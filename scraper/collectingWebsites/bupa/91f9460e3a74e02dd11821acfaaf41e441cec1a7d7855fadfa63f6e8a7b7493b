<div class="offer-info">
<p> A Bupa health assessment includes a series of tests and examinations carried out by our health advisors and Doctors* to give you an overview of your current health and to explore any health concerns that you have. Whether it’s a health concern that runs in the family or you need extra confidence to make lifestyle changes, we’re here for you. The great thing about health assessments is that they’re part of a 12-month health and wellbeing plan, and we’ll walk the journey with you for the whole year. This includes access to helpful apps, personalised coaching, and information tailored to your own health, lifestyle and goals that aim to make you feel better all over – in body and mind. </p>
<p> We have three health assessments for you to choose from: Be.Motivated, Be.Reassured and Be.Ahead.

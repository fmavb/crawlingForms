<p> Have you been missing those regular trips to the gym? Time to get fit again with Hussle’s discounted Monthly+ gym membership. Just commit for an initial 3-months and then you’re free to cancel at any time.             </p>
<p> Hussle’s Monthly+ Pass gives you unlimited access to multiple gyms which are on the Hussle gym platform. No sign-up fees. No inductions. One price. Swim, gym or spa at a venue near you. </p>
<p> Gyms closed? With most Monthly+ passes, you can also get access to online classes and training programmes, as well as live and on-demand yoga classes with Yogaia. Meaning that on the days you can’t get to the gym, the gym can come to you. All of that in one flexible pass. </p>

<about>
<p>
			The Compressed Mortality database contains mortality and population counts for all U.S. counties. 
			Counts and rates of death can be obtained by cause of death, state, county, age, race, sex, and year. 
			</p>
<p>
			This Request Form allows you to request <b>archive</b> data for the years 1979 - 1999 only, with the underlying cause of death 
			specified with ICD-9 codes. To request data for other years, see 
			<a href="/mortSQL.html">Compressed Mortality File</a>. 
			For more information, refer to <a href="/wonder/help/cmf.html#Compressed Mortality File: ICD Revision" onclick="setfocus('WONDER_Help')" target="WONDER_Help">
			Why Separate Query Pages?</a>
</p>
<p>
<b>Please Note: Archive data is available for comparison purposes only.</b>
</p><ul>
<li>The archive data has <b>different denominator populations and corresponding rates</b> than the current release.</li>
<li>
<i>Researchers are urged to use the <a href="/cmf-icd9.html">current release</a> query page with the intercensal (revised) estimates.</i>

		than for health statistical reporting and analysis, is against the law. Therefore users will:

		</p><ul>
<li>Use these data for health statistical reporting and analysis only. 
		</li>
<li>For sub-national geography, do not present or publish death counts of 9 or fewer or
			death rates based on counts of nine or fewer (in figures, graphs, maps, tables, etc.).
		</li>
<li>Make no attempt to learn the identity of any person or establishment included in these data.
		</li>
<li>Make no disclosure or other use of the identity of any person or establishment discovered inadvertently 
			and advise the NCHS Confidentiality Officer of any such discovery.
		</li>

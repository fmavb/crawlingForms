			Counts can be obtained by state, county, child's gender and weight, mother's bridged race, mother's age, mother's education, 
			gestation period, prenatal care, birth plurality, medical and tobacco use risk factors (mother). 
			The data is derived from birth certificates.

<b>Data Use Restrictions:</b>
</p>
<p>
		The Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 242m(d)) provides that the data collected by the 
		National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) may be used only for the purpose for which they were obtained; 
		any effort to determine the identity of any reported cases, or to use the information for any purpose other 
		than for health statistical reporting and analysis, is against the law. Therefore users will:

		</p><ul>
<li>Use these data for health statistical reporting and analysis only. 
		</li>
<li>For sub-national geography, do not present or publish birth counts of 9 or fewer or
			birth rates based on counts of nine or fewer (in figures, graphs, maps, tables, etc.).
		</li>
<li>Make no attempt to learn the identity of any person or establishment included in these data.
		</li>
<li>Make no disclosure or other use of the identity of any person or establishment discovered inadvertently 
			and advise the NCHS Confidentiality Officer of any such discovery.
		</li>
</ul>

    &lt;Title&gt;Shocking Care from Jubilee Day Surgery&lt;/Title&gt;
    &lt;ScreenName&gt;Jubilee Day Centre&lt;/ScreenName&gt;
    &lt;CommentText&gt;I have always been satisfied with the care received.  Find it difficult to compose a negative review as the result of one particularly member of staff nurse who spoils it for everyone else. All staff been amazing , polite , professional , caring however appalled the way I was spoken to by a Staff Nurse, clearly in the wrong profession. I undersrand trying to mobilise patients with the view of discharging as soon as possible (same day). If am honest , I am active and in my intentions to go home to reduce the risk of requiring a hospital acquired infection and of course to be with my family.  Unfortunately had a bad reaction to anaesthetic unsure if there is a correlation of having two operations due to a life threading illness. I was unbelievably sick , dizzy , dehydrated and could not keep a sip of water down. The Nurse never spoken to me but shouted &amp;amp;quot; you need to get yourself out of that bed and get moving &amp;amp;quot;. I was very drowsy. I was told to get changed &amp;amp;quot;now&amp;amp;quot; I do have a disability which is not visible. I fallen getting out of the bed into the chair only after having general anaesthetic a few hours ago as a result hurt myself. I was given No pain relief nor offered any anti sickness. I was there from 7 until 6pm and given one drink. Not that I was able to keep fluids down.  The same Nurse shouted at me again in front of patients , &amp;amp;quot;no wonder your dizzy- get your head out of that sick bowl &amp;amp;quot; Again belittled as she suggested I needed to move myself as &amp;amp;quot; my bum must be numb&amp;amp;quot;. I am normally physically fit  and keep myself very active but I was CLEARLY unwell.  My relatives stood at the door and rang the bell for more than twenty minutes , fortunately there was other relatives coming to collect - allegedly the lady which eventually came to open the door was moaning about the bell. Shame on you - You need a better system as current one does not work am afraid. I hope your satisfied as I was seen by my out of hours GP who was digusted I had been such discharged in such a state. You had a duty to ensure I was able to keep at least water down. Given no pain relief.  I had nothing to eat from 8pm the night before. I wouldent have been able to eat it but never even offered anything. You have a no visitors policy but because of a disability needed help getting changed hence why I fallen. This is no way to treat patients. Totally unethical. The Staff Nurse in question needs her elearning records reviewing for revalidation purposes. Other than that the nurses on duty early morning , fantastic. It's a shame one person can ruin it. To be told &amp;amp;quot;we have afternoon theatre lists patients needing these beds- you need to move &amp;amp;quot;. Required medical intervention as a result. You should have stabilised my sickness and ensures I could keep fluids down. She even made a sarcastic remark about acclumating three sick bowls ! In the wrong profession !&lt;/CommentText&gt;

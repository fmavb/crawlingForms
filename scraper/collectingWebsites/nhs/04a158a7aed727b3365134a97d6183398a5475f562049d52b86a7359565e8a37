    &lt;ScreenName&gt;Mr Gary Stephen Rolfe &lt;/ScreenName&gt;
    &lt;CommentText&gt;On the evening of April12th 2020,I had the misfortune to fall off my mountain bike breaking my wrist very badly.
My neighbour,on hearing me falling was kind enough to take me up to the A&amp;amp;E Department at the RPH which upon arrival I was triaged and immediately taken into the treatment room and x-rays were taken. 
I was then informed some time later by the lead doctor that after viewing my x-rays I would be given pain medication and my arm would be numbed and my wrist and hand would be pulled into place.
I went through the procedure described above and was discharged with pain medication.
The following day Monday13th I received a telephone call from a Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon who informed me that I would need to undergo corrective surgery and that this would take place at the RPH on the 18th April 2020.
On the morning of the 18th I made my way to Ward 3 RPH and was prepped for my surgery later that afternoon.
At the due time the duty male nurse on Ward 3 led me down to Operating Theatre 8 and greeted by the anaesthetist and his trainee assistant who informed me that due to me having just recently recovering from Pneumonia last December2019 I would not be given a general anaesthetic but instead would have my entire right arm numbed and with my consent this would be done via injections in my armpit region carried out by the lovely trainee anaesthetist under the very humorous and very professional guidance of the anaesthetist.
I felt absolutely nothing from the injections and after a short while I was informed that my arm was numb enough to be operated on, at which point the surgeon entered the theatre and after introducing himself talked me through the procedure he would undertake to correct my badly broken wrist and insert a titanium plate.
After about 90 minutes the surgeon informed me that he was pleased with the surgery and after stitching me back up and dressing my lower arm in a plaster cast I was taken back up to Ward 3 to sit and rest for a while before ordering a taxi and taken home.
My recovery during the following months and weeks was very painful in the early days but with the encouragement of the wonderful Physiotherapist team at Chorley Hospital and their regular video calls with me I made great progress and gradually regained the use of my hand and wrist.
After having a follow up call on September29th 2020 with my brilliant surgeon who I considered saved my hand and wrist he was happy to discharge me.
I cannot praise enough all the medical professionals who treated me during what was and still is a very difficult time for the NHS but I have to thank the A&amp;amp;E Department RPH who first treated me when I broke my wrist they were very professional and caring.
I would like to thank and praise the Physiotherapist's at Chorley Hospital for their caring motivation and professionalism.
A special word of thanks to the male nurse on Ward 3 and the surgery team in Theatre 8 RPH you are my heroes.
Thankyou Danke and God Bless You All.

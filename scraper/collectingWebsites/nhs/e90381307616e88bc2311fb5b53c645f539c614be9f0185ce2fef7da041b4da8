    &lt;Title&gt;Exemplary Care from the NHS&lt;/Title&gt;
    &lt;ScreenName&gt;Anonymous.&lt;/ScreenName&gt;
    &lt;CommentText&gt;My wife had a routine cervical smear (she had no symptoms) by the practice nurse at her GP surgery On 6 August 2019. 

By September 25 she had been admitted for colposcopy and biopsy, received specialist pathology opinions from three hospitals to establish a definitive diagnosis of endometrial cancer, had CT/MRI scans, EUA, pre-operative assessment and been discharged home following laparoscopic hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Review by a Consultant Oncologist was followed by brachytherapy at Bristol which she completed on 12 November.

Throughout this process, the care she received was outstanding. We were kept fully informed, every step patiently explained and we were treated at every stage and at every level with not only the utmost professionalism but also with respect, kindness and compassion.

Almost as soon as we set foot in Jasmine Ward at Yeovil Hospital, our initial fears were allayed by the recognition that these people would do their very best for her. On the Grace Unit at Musgrove Park and later at the Bristol Haematology and Oncology Centre, that sense of being &quot;cared for&quot; was maintained by every member of staff we encountered.

The media bombard us daily with the challenges faced by the NHS and of the criticism it all too often receives. Our experience, however, is an example of the superlative care of which it is not only capable but is delivering every day. 

This was very much a team effort at three hospitals (with histopathology input from a fourth). For this to work seamlessly, all those in the teams must not only be individually exceptional but must also share, have respect for and take pride in the principles and practice exemplified by those who lead them. 

We are profoundly grateful to ALL those who looked after my wife (and me) so well. The medical secretaries, receptionists, nurses, technicians, pathologists, radiographers, porters, housekeeping staff, anaesthetists, surgeons and oncologists amongst others. 

It in no way diminishes the contribution made by all these uniformly exemplary individuals however, that her two kind, calm, thoughtful Consultant Surgeons will remain heroes to this &quot;Old Girl&quot; for the rest of the life which their skill and care and that of their teams have returned to her. 

I could cite numerous examples of care&quot;beyond the necessary&quot; but one memory sums it all up for me. A nurse came to collect my wife from the Surgical Admissions Lounge and to walk her down to the Operating Theatre. First she took her arm but she then turned to me and said &quot;Don't worry - we'll look after her&quot;. 

And they did.

Thank you. All.

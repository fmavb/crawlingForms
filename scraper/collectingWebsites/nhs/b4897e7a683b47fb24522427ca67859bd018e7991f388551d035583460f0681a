    &lt;CommentText&gt;Apologies that this review is so late but didn’t know you could leave feedback!

I attended A&amp;amp;E in September 2019 after being ill for 3 weeks and visiting my GP 3 times during that time with what they diagnosed as a viral throat infection.  I was eventually diagnosed with tonsillitis on the Friday of the 3rd week and given antibiotics.  Unfortunately by the Sunday I was poorly that my parents made the decision to take me to A&amp;amp;E as I couldn’t even tolerate water!  When arriving at A&amp;amp;E I was out in the urgent waiting area, I must have looked very poorly.  Within an hour I was called into cubicles where 2 nurses assessed me and told me that my tonsils were so swollen and infected that they were touching and had closed my airway and I was borderline sepsis.  I was seen within 5 mins by a doctor who gave me IV antibiotics, steroid injection and I have no idea what else.  I was put on oxygen to make sure I was able to breathe.  He told me I needed to be admitted and would be transferred by ambulance due to my compromised airway to wolverhampton as there was no ENT admittance at Russell’s Hall on a weekend.  I was so poorly that I didn’t care what they did to me or where they needed to send me.  I was just so grateful that I was actually being taken serious and was getting the treatment that I so desperately needed.  I have suffered from tonsillitis since I was a child but I have never experienced anything like this and had my parents left it another few hours then I don’t know what would have happened but I genuinely believe that the outcome would have been very different &amp;amp; I would have been septic!!  

The staff were all amazing, including the receptionist that made the decision that I was so poorly that I needed to be seen urgently.  That decision was the difference from being seen within the hour and waiting up to 3 hrs for “normal” waiting time on that afternoon.  I did say thank you when I was well enough after being released from hospital where I spent 4 days with chocolates (which is always a winner) but I want to show my gratitude again to the amazing NHS staff. Your fast action and professional I believe literally saved my life and all from tonsillitis. Thank you, thank you, thank you xx&lt;/CommentText&gt;

    &lt;CommentText&gt;I recently had to stay in for a few nights and would like to leave feedback for 2 departments. Particularly EPAU which I would like to be shared with staff if possible.  
The staff on ISGU are absolutely amazing. It is such a fast paced unit but they do their best for the whole of the shift. You can see at the end of their shift they are shattered but nothing Is ever too much to ask. They are just completely normal people and have a conversation with you while they do their job making you feel like a human not just another bed. Most staff clearly enjoy their job and staff are sometimes like a little comedy show with their little whitty jokes to eachother. It just makes life seem more normal than it is at that moment In time. They know when this is appropriate and acted appropriately during situations.  
The staff on EPAU are the most amazing group of people you could wish for. I have visited there many many times over the past 4 years unfortunately for not nice reasons but they staff are amazing, they treat you with the most decency and respect you could wish for. They genuinely care and at that moment in time you are in their care you are the centre of existence. They arent rushing you or talking in riddles they are literally little angels of comfort and I absolutely love them all. I really hope this gets back to them as they all deserve to know they are getting the recognition they deserve for doing an amazing, (and what I can Imagine at times) heart breaking job.  
They even know me by name and remember things about me. This isnt just because I've been so many times, there are so many women through that door, I'd imagine its easy for once case to blend into the next, Its because they take their time and focus on YOU. They care about the people and the job they do.  
I have also through the NHS feedback system nominated a particular staff member for an award. The woman is just beyond amazing and is an actual angel. she may just think she I'd doing her job but my word she doesn't even realise how fantastic she is.  
I even spoke to a friend the other week about her and she replied; &amp;amp;quot;omg she looked after me too shes absolutely amazing and deserves to be recognised. I can't even thank her enough for all she did these past few days&amp;amp;quot;. My friend is a one off visitor who this member of staff has left an impression on so it shows she is consistently showing good practice for all patients new and repeat!&lt;/CommentText&gt;

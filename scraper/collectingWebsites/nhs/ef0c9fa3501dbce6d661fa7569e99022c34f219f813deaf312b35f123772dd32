    &lt;CommentText&gt;I attended with my adult daughter who had taken an overdose for the first time in her life and I had had to get us an ambulance at 11 pm It was a terrifying experience but she remained conscious and the paramedic was lovely and reassured us a lot. On arrival at the dept the first nurse we met was kind but we didn’t see her much after that, we were left alone for a long period after first obs were done and the nurse left without a word. The paramedic had handed over so I presume they didn’t want to ask us any questions. After a while the first nurse popped by and gave us both a cup of tea. She explained briefly they would be keeping an eye on her. An hour or so later a nurse with no introduction, no conversation took her BP and obs. I asked at this point what was happening, I stated should we be worried, what about the risk ofthe overdose?  I was petrified. So scared, but  she replied they would do blood test after 4 hours and dr would review. She made no effort to talk further and left the open cubicle. We sat their for a further 3 hours. There was no signal on the phone so I couldn’t contact her dad or partner without leaving her. I didn’t dare leave her. The blood test time came and she had an ecg. Again, no one introduced themselves. I heard no names, not one person asked how are you of my daughter or myself. Not one. An an hour after the test a dr came to say if an ecg was ok the blood test was ok and we could go, he stated no psyche referral had been made - would we like one!?!? At this point my daughter was actually feeling worse about herself than when she took the overdose. She was feeling that she had caused trouble for the staff who didn’t care. She declined the referral. No one asked how are you. I have never been so scared in all my life as a mother. By 6am we were  tired, dehydrated and exhausted. We got moved to a filthy little room where an agency nurse came and said she had to do an ecg. My daughter was so upset after she failed 3 times to fit paper and the leads and lifted her shirt without consent to reattach when they had fallen off mid reading. The nurse again, gave no name, no interest was shown in this human in her care. The dr came half an hour later to tell us we could go. No information, no explanation of the ecgs or the blood test, just that we could go. We left. It took me 4 hours to persuade my daughter to visit the  GP that day. The treatment she received was less than basic. It was without compassion or care. We were a nuisance. An overdose. A life that didn’t count because we were without a fracture or a fall or a fever.  The irony is that 4 weeks later I attended with my elderly mother by ambulance after a fall. Her treatment couldn’t have been more different. Care, compassion, food, water, scans tests, checks, everything was in abundance. Again I sat beside watching as the carer, but this time I got offered tea and sympathy. So it’s mental Ill health that doesn’t matter here.&lt;/CommentText&gt;

<p><em>Consultant in Medical Oncology</em></p>
<p>I have always loved looking after teenagers and young adults and am now very fortunate to be the Lead Clinician. I enjoy looking after people from their diagnosis right through their treatment and subsequent follow up. I think it is equally important not only to focus on the patient but also their family to enable all to get through this difficult period of time.</p>
<p>I am fortunate that I work with colleagues who are all equally committed to their roles and so we provide a very good, patient and family centred service to all.</p>

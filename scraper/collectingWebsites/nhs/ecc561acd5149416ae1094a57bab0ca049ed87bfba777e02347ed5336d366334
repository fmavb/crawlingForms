    &lt;CommentText&gt;After my inital consultation, I was told to await a phone call to book me in for a procedure. That phone call never came and a few weeks later I got fed up and phoned myself I was then booked in on a date two weeks later. I phoned a few days before as I hadn't heard anything else, to be told that I was not booked in and offered a date a month later. I had no other choice so had to accept. Then we rinse and repeat, about a week before I phoned for more info, and yet again, I apparently had not been booked in. I was then given another date which was unfrotunately cancelled due to COVID-19. 

I then phoned a few weeks ago where a secretary told me there was a slot on the 7th August which I accepted and had a telephone consultation with the surgeon the next day. A few days passed and I phoned to book my COVID-19 test, and they were surprised to hear that I had been told the 7th August, however did their best to fit me in. I then recieved a phone call to book in a COVID test which I did, only to get a phone call the day before my booked COVID test to ask if I had been contacted about a COVID test, where I responded with my booked in slot only to be told, I was not booked into that slot. I then travelled to New Hall Hospital to have my COVID test the day before I was due to go, thankfully due to a last minute cancellation. I was then told I would receive a phone call two working days before my procedure to give me my allotted time, which never came so naturally I enquired only to be told that I was not on the list. 

There seems to be a complete and utter lack of organisation within the administrative side of this hospital. On the occasions I have spoken with a clinicina, they seem incredibly compassionate and good at what they do, the difficulty lies in actually seeing one.

Whilst I am strong believer that patients, NHS or private, shuld be treated the same, I sincerely hope those individuals who have trusted this hospital with their hard earned money, recieve more respect than I have done in the last 6 months.&lt;/CommentText&gt;

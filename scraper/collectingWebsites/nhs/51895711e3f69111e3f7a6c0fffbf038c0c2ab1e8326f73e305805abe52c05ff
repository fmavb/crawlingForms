    &lt;Title&gt;Fantastic experience&lt;/Title&gt;
    &lt;ScreenName&gt;Anonymous&lt;/ScreenName&gt;
    &lt;CommentText&gt;My son was transferred to Salford Royal for emergency spinal surgery in early February. We had just celebrated his 18 birthday and this illness came out of the blue. He was extremely fit and active prior to this. 
After experiencing unusual symptoms he was eventually diagnosed in Macclesfield as suffering from a spinal abscess and had lost some sensation below the waist on admission. They sought advice from specialists at Salford Royal who advised immediate transfer. From the minute we landed at Salford Royal both the staff and treatment were excellent. 
This was an extremely challenging and stressful time for the family with a positive outcome far from guaranteed. The consultant surgeon met us soon after arrival. He was open, honest and explained everything. He offered no false guarantees, which was difficult to hear at the time but appreciated. They acted fast and arranged surgery within a few hours despite complications with blood clotting, a complication of the infection that had to be rectified prior to surgery. 
After surgery he was transferred to ward H5 where we found the staff friendly, supportive and helpful. When I left each evening I was reassured he was in safe hands. Communication was excellent throughout. I am so grateful to all from the medical staff and physios through to the domestics who kept his room spotless and staff who worked hard to keep him well fed during his recovery.
We felt well supported throughout, and following discharge we returned for a routine dressing change; one of the doctors sought us out to enquire about how my son was doing post discharge. 
The aftercare has been amazing and we have received all follow up input as we were advised. 
My son has recovered so well his functioning is almost back to normal after a few months, an outcome that could only be dreamed of at the point of admission. 
Canâ€™t fault the care received in any way. First class!! Keep up the good work Salford Royal.
From an extremely grateful Mum&lt;/CommentText&gt;

    &lt;CommentText&gt;My maternity care was transferred from Macc to SH. Although my care during my c-section was second to none, I can't say the same for the care on the ward. First I was sent home from my pre-op without medication so had to return. Then on the day of the section we waited from 7.30am-4pm for the operation with around 3-4hrs of no communication from staff to be told we were almost going home because it was late. My first night on the ward was good with some staff being very supportive and helping to change baby, support with  breastfeeding and respond to need for pain relief. However, one member of staff did put baby in bed with me along with my changing bag and said I would have to change baby myself because she was too busy. She never came back so I ended up co-sleeping, something I never wanted to do, especially on my first night as a first time mum. After one night I was feeling ready to go home and asked for the baby checks to be completed so we could be discharged. We asked different staff members all day to be told at 4pm that the staff who conducted the checks weren't around so I would have to stay another night. I could have gone home but would have had to return at 10am the next day and wait to be seen. I reluctantly stayed to multiple car journeys. My second night was unfortunately a busy night. I felt like I was left alone. Pain relief took ages to come, no support with a poor latch, no support with baby because I was mobile after having the catheter removed and limited response to the buzzers being pressed in my room for other women's first nights so lots of crying babies and unsupported new mums. A sad night to be a part of unfortunately. I completely understand that it was a busy few days and under the current pressure of covid19 maybe things are different. However, I do feel the level of care was below par and there could certainly be some improvements. &lt;/CommentText&gt;

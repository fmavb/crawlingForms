    &lt;Title&gt;They care more about their targets than patients.&lt;/Title&gt;
    &lt;ScreenName&gt;Anonymous&lt;/ScreenName&gt;
    &lt;CommentText&gt;I recently posted a review in which I questioned whether or not the hospital were rejecting as many referrals as they could back to GPs. For those not in the know, the hospital are supposed to be able to treat a patient within 18 weeks of the referral being made. Where they are struggling to hit these targets, it makes sense that they will be be trying to reject as many referrals as they can to reduce patient throughput.

A Matron responded to my review, and I was hopeful that some kind of agreement could be reached. This has not been the case.

I have a long history of problems with heavy menstrual bleeding. In the past, I have experienced pelvic pain. This has returned after it was sorted by surgery last year. My referral was rejected as apparently, the symptoms could be managed by my GP.

A few comments:

- The &amp;amp;quot;treatments&amp;amp;quot; available via my GP involve either tranexamic acid (which would reduce heavy bleeding), or hormonal interventions.

- The hormonal interventions are not an option as I am already suicidally depressed, and there is a significant risk that they would either destabilise my mood, or lower my mood even further. I should add that I have absolutely no support. (I would add that the Mirena coil is often touted as an option. The idea is that it delivers the hormones locally, but even Bayer's website admits that it can cause systemic effects. I will not be forced to have this fitted). 

- I pointed out that I had this conversation with one of the registrars last year. She realised that I suffer from absolutely crushing, debilitating depression, and I told her that was why I was reluctant to try anything hormonal. She was sympathetic, and didn't try to tell me that my suspicions were wrong.

- I asked the Matron to provide evidence that tranexamic acid would help with the pelvic pain. (My understanding is that it would not). She has refused to provide this evidence.

- I asked the Matron to state - unambiguously - for the record that the gynaecologists expect an already suicidal patient to be subjected to hormonal treatment that is likely to be damaging to them. She has refused to do this. 

- I asked them to re-instate my referral, and ensure that the RTT is based on the initial referral from my GP. I don't believe that it should have been rejected in the first place. I said if they were not willing to do this (they weren't), I wanted copies of:
    - the letter from my GP
    - the rejection letter from Musgrove
    - the relevant NICE guidelines etc., along with written evidence that you cannot alter the treatment pathway due to individual patient circumstances.

None of this has been provided.

I have made the point (and I'm sorry if I'm over-sharing in the context of a review) that I would really like to be able to have sex again. Apparently this is not important to anyone other than myself. Although I cannot help suspecting that, if I was male, this might be considered more important.

Overall, I'm pretty appalled.&lt;/CommentText&gt;

    &lt;Title&gt;Visit to MIU with 6 year old with broken arm&lt;/Title&gt;
    &lt;ScreenName&gt;Anonymous&lt;/ScreenName&gt;
    &lt;CommentText&gt;Maybe we should have gone to a&amp;amp;amp;e but we visited the MIU on a Sunday, the first receptionist was friendly and told us to wait around the corner which we did. We waited for a few minutes, my friend's daughter was crying and in terrible pain. No-one came to assess her, even though we had told the first receptionist we thought her arm was broken so whether they did not get that message or whether they do not prioritise straight away I don't know. After a few minutes when it was clear no-one was coming to have a look at her I had to go and find someone to ask them to give her some pain meds, I was very polite and explained she probably has broken it and was in terrible pain. The first person I asked worked in x-ray (it took me a while to find anyone) and he was extremely defensive, and actually rather rude, and responded to me as thought I had upset him by making a huge complaint, which I had not. I was simply asking him how long we would have to wait to be seen and can we have some pain meds for the child. He told me to go and look for someone else. The second person I eventually found was again very defensive - I simply asked politely for the meds and asked how long we would have to wait as we had been told 2 hours minimum and we could go somewhere else if it would be quicker. She said repeatedly we are going as fast as we can and the child is some way down the list so couldn't give me any idea on timeframe but it would probably be 2 hours so go somewhere else if you want. However she did then come over to us pretty much straight away and once she saw the state the child was in she became very caring and helpful. She then prioritised us. However then the first man x-rayed the arm, wouldn't let one of her parents sit with her (which was not explained as to why because this happens in other hospitals if the child is young and very upset never having had an x-ray before) and her parents said he seemed to turn her arm over very quickly for the x-rays. It hurt her significantly when he turned her arm over. Then when he showed us where to go for the next part of the treatment, as he walked away he made a sarcastic sounding comment to us &amp;amp;quot;how's THAT for service&amp;amp;quot; (presumably because he was still upset that I had asked him for information and pain meds previously). The rest of her care was excellent and I cannot fault the caring approach of the nurses (including the second one) who looked after her after that point. Whilst I understand he was clearly having a bad day and the staff are under immense pressure every day and probably have to deal with unreasonable people all the time, there was just no need for that type of attitude at all and frankly it made a traumatic experience worse. All I did was ask him for help. The child's arm is badly broken and she was in so much pain and if I hadn't then she would have been sat there without any pain meds for goodness knows how long.&lt;/CommentText&gt;

    &lt;CommentText&gt;We were greeted on arrival by many parents with youngsters awaiting inpatient care. Staff took us through in a patient determined order, which was actually very reassuring. We were properly Covid assessed, given a brief summary that supported why we were there and shown to a waiting room where we were able to relax pending the little man going for his surgery.  
Nurses were busy but still able to make time to ensure we were OK while waiting. It felt well organised, and although we were tentative at the prospect, the calm around the place was very welcome and made us feel relatively confident about what would happen.  
My wife was asked to stay overnight, so she had a room and space to relax, even taking him down to theatre to hand him over helped reassure her and him. When he came back, nurses explained what to expect and what they could help with. He was fine, even when drowsy he just looked himself! As he started to come around nurses would routinely visit or respond to his monitor bleeping. I was able to feed him as normal and though he would come around, he felt comfortable to dose off when he had fed. This helped my wife feel that she was seeing good quality care and the correct level of attention to his needs.  
Due to Covid and in spite of reassurance around all the protocols put in place, my wife didn't want to leave him or the room. Nurses were great, they understood, even offering to let my wife have meals or drinks in the room.  
When I picked her up the following day although tired from the overnight stay, she had nothing but praise for all staff, medical, nursing and auxiliaries. Pleased to say within a few days our little man is doing well and well on the mend. Thanks to all at ward 1A QEH for their fantastic support!&lt;/CommentText&gt;

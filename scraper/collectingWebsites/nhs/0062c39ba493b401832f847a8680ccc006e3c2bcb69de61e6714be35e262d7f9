    &lt;Title&gt;Sister and her colitis A&amp;amp;amp;E&lt;/Title&gt;
    &lt;ScreenName&gt;shan2208&lt;/ScreenName&gt;
    &lt;CommentText&gt;My sister has been struggling with her colitis for many years now! And is often in a flare and rushed to hospital, however the last 2 times we have visited it’s been a very awful experience. She was in agony on the first visit and barley able to sit while screaming in pain for help left after seeing the triage nurse for almost 4 hours before giving a bed or any decent pain relief other then paracetamol!! She was in bad way staff nurse on duty once give a bed had then given her oramorph to help gave her a lot in such short time she was about to pass out and fall of the bed, she was sitting on the edge in pain !! I asked for help to get on the bed ( no help) after another hour hour pain meds where eating off, again she in terrible pain like her insides are being ripped out , the nurse walks in looks at her looks at notes and goes to walk away, to which I said can you please help her, she shouted at my self and my sisiter that she had other people to deal with, her bed side manners where awful , she didn’t try to calm her she didn’t try to help at all  just kept rolling her eyes, I let it slide because I thought well the pressure of A&amp;amp;amp;e and maybe busy! Tonight we have ended up back in there again all the staff that dealt with tonight was amazing, but that same staff nurse made the decision that she should be transported to the ward with no pain realif I heard her at the staff desk saying just send her up they can sort it,  then a few of them laughed until they saw me, as I walked pass the desk I tried to get her name, no name badge so asked polity another nurse !  I got her name and carried on out to follow my sis to the ward as I was at the bottom she came shouting down the corridor “ you wanted my name” in front all patience and staff coming straight up to my face, I explained why I was annoyed that she shouldn’t be transported with no pain relief, I also explain the last time we was in there what she had done! She was just shouting at me saying well we don’t have time to put the Iv in, she had her time in A&amp;amp;amp;E if I had a problem last time why didn’t I say something etc I explain I was dealing with my sisiter and I let it slide! She was continuing to shout as I walked away! She is terrible nurse she has no compassion for patients just walks around as if she owns the place!! I couldn’t believe how she dealt with that situation, as I walked away she made a comment about respecting the care!  I respect everyone that has given my sister care , but think that’s a 2 way street when clearly has no respect for her patients and decided to just get them gone so she doesn’t have to deal with it!  Or stands there laughing at staff desk about getting her upstairs!! Disgusting nurse and I hope I never come in to contact with her again her care is shocking! And I will be making an official complaint!! However AMC ward Amazing a credit to the hospital!!!amazing staff couldn’t make her more comfortable if they tried!! Thank you AMC ward amazing job!&lt;/CommentText&gt;

    &lt;CommentText&gt;Attended the AMU as a last resort, a friend who’s first language isn’t English, with suspected DVT. They were unable to perform a scan when first presented 3 days ago, and was sent home with a scan appointment 8 days later, and prescribed 18,000 units of anti-coagulant in the mean time, she developed bruising, nausea, stomach and chest pains and darkened stools, so community nurse referred her back to AMU. On arriving I was asked who I was and then told to wait outside as I was only a friend. I informed them I was acting as interpreter, to which the response was doesn’t she speak English? ... duh! That was implied in the statement and obvious, but white peoples like to ask this non-the less to bring home how strange a thing this is and make one feel uncomfortable, I’ve come across the same question repeatedly. I was told that there was no space and would have to go away. I asked what their policy on dealing with patients of a BAME background was, and was told about amount of space again, they tried to state the same thing a third time, and I stopped them to clarify, I wasn’t asking for an assessment on their current situation but rather the policy, to which I was told that’s what they’re trying to tell me but was interrupting (BAME people often come across as augmentative to white people when they are not, but simply asking questions or sticking up for themselves), but they just repeated themselves about space again. I asked again about policy and they said it was to get someone on the phone as an interpreter, maybe a family member. I agreed to wait outside, but remained worried if she would get the due care and attention as a BAME individual with limited English, so I said I didn’t want to hear that her condition worsened suddenly while I was away, they quite rightly stated that they had no control over a condition worsening. I agreed with them but reminded them that they still had control over how they looked after a patient and how they responded to a worsening patient, because god knows I’ve   already seen how the NHS deal with My BAME friends and family, and coming to the hospital during the COVID-19 panademic is already the thing of nightmares. &lt;/CommentText&gt;

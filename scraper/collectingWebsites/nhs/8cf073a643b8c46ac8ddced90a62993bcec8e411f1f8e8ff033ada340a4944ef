    &lt;Title&gt;Multiple cancellations of Appointment for Hernia repair&lt;/Title&gt;
    &lt;ScreenName&gt;Nick Roberts&lt;/ScreenName&gt;
    &lt;CommentText&gt;Within the space of a week and a half my appointment with the ACAD Unit of Central Middlesex Hospital for an epigastric hernia repair has been cancelled twice. Both appointments were scheduled to be undertaken at the weekend.

The notification of the second cancellation was done at such short notice that it was done over the telephone.  I was out at the GP surgery at the time and therefore unable to take any call on  my landline. It appears that the CMH appointments  staff had first tried to telephone me on my landline. When I failed to answer, they didn't leave a message on my answerphone, but instead  telephoned  my next-of-kin, at  work, at the other end of country. This occurred  late in the afternoon of the day before I was due to attend for Surgery. Although I'd previously given my next-of-kin the heads-up on my forthcoming surgery, getting this call out-of-the blue perturbed and wrong-footed them.

Also of concern was the fact that the CMH appointments staff told my next-of-kin that the reason for the  second cancellation was that the ACAD unit of CMH could not offer overnight stay facilities - ( I had previously been told at the surgical pre-assessment conducted at Northwick Park Hospital (Part of the same hospital Trust as CMH) that because I had declared to them that I would  unescorted after the operation (Relatives are 200 miles away), that Trust rules required that I stay in over night after the Operation, being discharged the following day.

My next-of-kin, although slightly wrong-footed by the unexpected phone call, had the nouse to question the above assertion and asked why then had their staff had selected a Saturday for the booking of the most recent appointment. No answer was forthcoming.

This immediately gives you a firm (Negative) impression of &amp;amp;quot;The way they roll&amp;amp;quot; at this Authority.

I also happen to be a recovering Blood cancer patient (Lymphoma)  and cardiac patient still under the care of Northwick Park Haematology department, where cancellation of OPD appointments by the hospital and re-scheduling at a later date is a regular feature. But that, to an extent, is less troublesome as the appointments are at  6 month intervals - unlike this  Hernia exercise.

Anyway, I've had such a gut-full of the World-leading NHS (In publicity only), where poor admin and lower grade support staff are invariably the cause of complaint, that after this last event I've made an E-Mail complaint to the CEO of the Trust, copying in the Secretary of State for Health and my local MP. 

Unfortunately, the impression made earlier is re-inforced, as the CEO's E-mail response tells me that she's out of office until the 25th February, which, you'll never guess, is the date of my re-scheduled appointment - and she doesn't state whether E-mails are being automatically referred to her deputy in her absence.&lt;/CommentText&gt;

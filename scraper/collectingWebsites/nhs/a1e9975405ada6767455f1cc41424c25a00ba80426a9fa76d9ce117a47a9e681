    &lt;CommentText&gt;Visited outpatients twice and had a procedure done too. Had to call to find out why I hadn't received an appointment after being told there was a 4 week waiting time. When I called after 5 weeks they hadn't even bothered to make an appointment so had to wait another 4 weeks. Procedure was then double booked and I received a letter with two different dates, I called them to ask some questions and before I had finished my sentence the receptionist transferred me to another number that kept ringing, without telling me she was transferring me. Called several times again to try and speak to someone and had the phone picked up and put down on me. Eventually I got through to a secretary who was very pleasant and apologetic, shame the same couldn't be said about the reception staff. Had to have a gastroscopy and was told I had the choice to have sedation. They advised they would start the procedure then if I couldn't do it they would stop and sedate me. I wasn't able to stop the gastroscopy as they never gave me the chance. I found it upsetting and rather brutal, and after the procedure the specialist asked in a very sarcastic manner if I had 'stopped crying'. I then left the room and was given a piece of paper with the name of a condition, no explanation whatsoever and told I could go home. During both outpatient appointments I felt that the receptionist was insolent, and had an unpleasant attitude. During both of my consultations she walked into the room where I was seeing the specialist without knocking. I have never had this happen at an NHS hospital, and found this to be very unprofessional. She offered no apology for walking in on my appointment. My husband was with me and he was disgusted. I unfortunately have to visit again for another procedure and have no confidence in them. Whilst on my second outpatient appointment I heard another visitor be told that their appointment had been cancelled and they weren't aware of it, makes me wonder what the management is like at this hospital. Given that I have to travel an hour to get there, I wish I had chosen an NHS hospital instead of this one for my treatment. If I had paid privately for this service I would be appalled, although I doubt that private patients receive this kind of treatment. If I am ever given the choice to visit this hospital instead of my local NHS hospital I will refuse. Unfortunately I am stuck with this choice whilst I receive treatment for my current condition.&lt;/CommentText&gt;

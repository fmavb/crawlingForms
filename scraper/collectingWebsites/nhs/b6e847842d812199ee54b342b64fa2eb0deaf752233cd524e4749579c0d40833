    &lt;CommentText&gt;I am disgusted by the service and lack of care provided by the Willow Ward. I feel like I need to provide this feedback even though I'm sure it won't make a difference. I was told by a midwife that I needed an Anti D injection as soon as possible due to potential internal bleeding. The Midwife then booked me in for an appointment at 7pm at the Willow Ward at Musgrove Hospital for a blood sample and an Anti D injection. When I arrived at the Willow Ward the waiting room was empty but for some reason they still made me wait 30 minutes before taking a blood sample. All the while there were a few care assistants chatting nearby. I asked the person doing the blood sample if they knew what it was for and was told no and that they had been told to take a sample and that was it. I knew that the sample was to confirm if there had been internal bleeding. After the blood sample I was told to go wait in the empty waiting room again. The staff member doing the blood test then comes up to me later with the label for my blood test asking me to check that my name was spelt correctly, which it wasn't, even though they had my papers. I was then left waiting in the lobby for a further 3 hours, waiting for an Anti D injection. The care assistants were too busy chatting amongst themselves the whole time. I had to repeatedly go up to them to try to find out what was going on and why I was waiting so long. They were not able to provide me with any answers and it seemed like they didn't know anything. They just kept saying that they will ask someone. In total I had been left waiting in the empty lobby by myself for 3. 5 hours. My husband wasn't allowed in even though it was only me there and the waiting room could hold 4 people with social distancing. The care assistants did not even offer me a glass of water or anything. They just ignored me for 3. 5 hours until I finally broke down crying from the whole situation and from pain from sitting in the same seat for so long. At that point they saw me crying and went and got a midwife who gave me the Anti D injection. I asked the Midwife why it took so long and they said that they didn't realise I was waiting for so long. This is hard to believe because I had a booking for 7pm and it was now 10:30pm. I was the only person in the waiting room so everyone saw me sitting there and kept looking at me as they walked past. I asked when I would know the results of the blood test and the midwife said they may have them tomorrow. So there was no explanation why it took 3.5 hours for an Anti D injection.&lt;/CommentText&gt;

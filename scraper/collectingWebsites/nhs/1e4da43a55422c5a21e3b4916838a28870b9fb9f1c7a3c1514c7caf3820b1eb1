    &lt;Title&gt;Horrible A&amp;amp;amp;E experience&lt;/Title&gt;
    &lt;ScreenName&gt;Anonymous&lt;/ScreenName&gt;
    &lt;CommentText&gt;I went to the QHS A&amp;amp;amp;E last Tuesday due to very severe pain in my lover chest, sides and back, coupled with a pain in my lower abdomen. My thoughts were on my kidneys. The A&amp;amp;amp;E was not too busy and the receptionist took a quick stock of my issues and signed me in. I waited for about an hour to be called in to the nurse's office, which was honestly surprisingly short, considering my previous experience with the NHS. This is, however, the end of anything positive. The nurse who checked me in was clearly in a bad mood, asked me what my emergency was and then proceeded to tell me that this is not an emergency because I had been having the pain the whole day and I should have gone to my GP instead or waited until tomorrow. She would not even let me finish explaining that I have some other sources of pain and how severe it is or I have been feeling, only took my vitals whilst proceeding to very aggressively tell me that I am not sick enough to be warrant a visit and should not have come. At this point I was just sort of in shock and did not have any strength to try to explain how much I was hurting. She then sent out into the waiting room only to call me back in because she forgot to ask me for a urine sample (good, I thought, we're getting somewhere, that's how a kidney issue would be found out. I thought wrong, this is the last I've heard anything about the sample). I was so shocked by her treatment that I had a panic attack after I came back into the waiting room (which seemed to bother none of the staff there at all) and continued crying for the rest of my visit. After about another hour I got seen by a doctor who seemed to think I was having an issue with my lungs and sent me to an x-ray without giving me any chance to properly explain my situation. He was very dismissive of how much pain I was in, telling me that I don't look like anything hurts. (mind you, I am visibly in distress. also crying makes the pain so much worse. I feel like knives are being stabbed into my sides). The x-ray technician was really nice and the only person who seemed to care that I was so distressed. Back to the waiting room, back to the doctor. X-ray is fine, so all the other things (I assumed this included a test of my urine sample) I am to take ibuprofen (which I have told both the nurse and the doc I am allergic to) and come back if it does not go away. Lo and behold, a few days later, after the pain continues, I go to my GP and am told that I indeed have a kidney infection and am given antibiotics and painkillers. All the GP did to get this diagnosis was listen to my description of the pain and take a urine sample. Why did no one figure this out at the A&amp;amp;amp;E? Who knows. I do know that I have not in a long time felt as dismissed and disregarded as a person as I felt then. I also haven't cried that much in a while. (Sadly, this was not my first bad experience here, while staff was nice the last time, they also failed to give a diagnosis.)&lt;/CommentText&gt;

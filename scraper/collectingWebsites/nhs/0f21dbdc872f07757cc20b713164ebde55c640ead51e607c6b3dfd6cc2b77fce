    &lt;Title&gt;Clinical excellence but appalling parking facilities&lt;/Title&gt;
    &lt;ScreenName&gt;Sandy Knowles&lt;/ScreenName&gt;
    &lt;CommentText&gt;I have to visit the ENT Nurse led clinic on a very regular basis and have found the staff to be highly proficient, professional and dedicated to providing exemplary patient care. Nothing is too much trouble to them to provide an excellent patient outcome in a friendly, professional atmosphere - so full credit to all the staff in that unit.

However the situation that soured my recent visit was the appalling lack of functional use of the new car parking arrangements. The pay station on car park G was none functional which I only discovered after keying in my registration and waiting for 10 minutes for something to happen on the machine. When nothing happened I eventually managed to get the initially none responsive touch delete keys to cancel the transaction and let two other queueing people to make their attempts at payment - to the same resultant end. A passing attendant attempted to help with the same result and directed the five people (including myself) to the pay station in the Sharoe Green unit. On arrival their was quite a queue for payment at a very slowly responding machine and all the people were complaining that it had taken so long for the machine to pictorially recognise their vehicle that every one of them had been placed into the next pay band - myself included. This gave rise to the shared opinion that the machines installed were not fit for purpose and were a very convenient way for the parking management company to take pecuniary advantage of patients attending the hospital by gaining additional income from a flawed payment process. Many of the queueing patients were quite angry at the situation. I mentioned the problem to the parking attendant who was still at the pay station on car park G trying to resolve that issue and he very kindly apologised and did state that the current set up was not really fit for purpose as there had been numerous problems with the new set up. This probably explained why there were so many unoccupied spaces on that car park which from my previous attendances was quite unusual.
Hopefully the powers that be can ensure that a satisfactory payment service is in existence by the time of my next visit in early April as I do not relish the thought of having to take another 35 minutes to exit the car park.&lt;/CommentText&gt;

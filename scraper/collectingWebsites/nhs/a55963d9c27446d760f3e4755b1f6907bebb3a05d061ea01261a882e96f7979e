    &lt;ScreenName&gt;Just me 123&lt;/ScreenName&gt;
    &lt;CommentText&gt;I called an ambulance for the first time in my life as my pains in my stomach were unbearable. Paramedics were fantastic!  
I was admitted to a&amp;amp;amp;e at 2am and gave pain relief. By 9am they still hadn't take a blood sample from me. By 10am i was sent to SAU. I have previously been there before with the same problem. I was not offered a drink or anything to eat. Even tho i was there for 8 hours. And the only drink i had was given to me by the paramedics. As i was on morphine and needed a drink in the ambulance.  
At around 2pm i saw a bowel specialist, who didnt think it was a bowel problem. At around 7pm i finally saw a gynae doctor. Who recommended i have a TV scan. And that i waited in the waiting room until i was called. I was in absolute agony throughout the day and asked for my prescribed medication about 4 times. Which i had to wait 1 hour and 30 mins for. Kindly one particular nurse actually listened and gave me my required pain relief.  
Around 10pm i went to the toilet near SAU reception desk, then asked if i was seeing a doctor again or if i needed a scan as i was very hungry and needed some fresh air. To be told a very nasty attitude way that I wouldn't see a doctor and I was going home, which was to my surprise and very upset me. The nurse did not need to approach me in such an unwell manner. Especially while i am experiencing significant amount of pain. At this point i felt my chest get tight and i could not breath. I said to the nurse i need 5 mins because i was frustrated at the fact that i had been sat there for nearly 19 hours. Just to be sent home. The nurse then followed me into the corridor saying i cant leave without taking my canular out, as i was going off the ward. Which i then explained i needed 5 mins alone. And that i had previously left the ward whilst still having the canular in.  
I made my way to the a&amp;amp;amp;e department as the main entrance was closed at the time. To then have a panic attack for the first time of my life. I had cleaners come up to me asking if i was okay. I should not experienced that in that situation of me being there for help whilst that nurse made my pains even worse. I then went back to SAU for the nurse to respond with attitude again by saying... the doctors have done a lot of investigations. They cant do anymore. What is my problem? At this point i felt every nurse and every person in the waiting area was looking at me. I suffer from depression and anxiety and for me to sit around a lot of strangers was a big deal whilst in pain. But i had nowhere/no-one else to turn to. At this point they then took the canular out and just put a piece of fabric on my hand and walked out of the triage room. They didnt even offer me pain relief for me to go home with. I have never felt so belittled and humiliated in all my life.  
I then had to wait for the next day for a lovely nurse to call me. She was amazing and helped me through the anxiety of coming back to the ward for my scan. I then was notified that my scan was postponed until the following day. So i had to stay at home and try and cope with the pains. This person did offer me to come back to SAU for them to help manage the pain. But i didn't want to be there if i felt i wasn't being believed that i was actually in pain.  
But i honestly do not think i would have courage to go to SAU if them 2 nurses didn't believe in me. And be there for me. And understand the stress and pain i was going through. I explained the events to a family friend who has recommended i report this to PALS and CQC. Because the treatment i received that day was unacceptable. And if it wasn't for them 2 nurses i know i would not return back to RHH even if i couldn't cope with my pains at home.  
I just hope my experience can help to improve the level of services provided by some staff.&lt;/CommentText&gt;

    &lt;CommentText&gt;My 4 year old son cut his head open a just over 3 weeks ago and we had to go to A&amp;amp;E to have it seen to. We were seen promptly and the friendly receptionist directed us to the children’s waiting area which my son loved with all the paintings on the walls and books to look at. We were soon seen by a nurse who took some details then the max fax doctor came and spoke to my son (who is very nervous and quite shy) and was really friendly, he was delighted as she gave him some stickers and a toy puzzle to play with and take home (little things make a 4 y olds day!). She explained the different options we had and we chose to stay and have stitches done there and then. I was really pleased with the way that everything was explained clearly and choices made very clear. Then we had to wait a while for the numbing gel to be applied then again waited for it to work, we were made comfortable , my little boy laid on the couch on me as he was nervous being on his own and the made sure that I was comfortable and reassured me as well as my son. 
Then he had the stitches done, this was all explained to my son in a way he could understand and they kindly put peppa pig on for him to watch ; and it was all very skilfully done , although my son didn’t enjoy having the stitches put in it was done in the most reassuring way possible. 
Then it was partly glued and steristrips put over the top. 
I was a bit worried about the scar as it’s just above his eyebrow, but I am pleased to say now the scab &amp;amp; steristrips have come off there is a really neat line of a scar. Very impressed with the handiwork of the doctor so well done !!! Thank you.
Apart from actually having the stitches put in my son enjoyed the hospital experience!!!!!  One happy mummy &amp;amp; little boy. Thank you again. Keep up the good work and keep smiling. &lt;/CommentText&gt;

<p>Staff at Woodland Hospital have been busy over the last couple of months supporting a number of local charities through various different events and fundraising opportunities. The staff engagement team at the hospital always have plans about how to raise money for both local and national charities. Read about some of our recent successes:</p>
<p><strong>Motor Neuron Disease Association<br/></strong>Staff proudly handed over a cheque for £2,685 to the Motor Neuron Disease Association after a number of fundraising activities took place throughout the hospital including bake sales, quizzes, a valentines win the bottle and guess how many sweets in the Jar competition.</p>
<p><strong>Kettering Food Bank<br/></strong>Staff throughout the hospital kindly donated various different food items to Kettering Foodbank to help local residents in need.</p>
<p><strong>Macmillan Cancer Research<br/></strong>Friday 29th September staff at the hospital took part in a charity bake off and cake sale as part of the annual Macmillan coffee morning. It was a great success with £177.30 being raised for such a great cause. The winner of the staff bake off was Nadia from the Pharmacy – well done Nadia!</p>
<p><strong>Riding for the Disabled<br/></strong>A raffle in aid for Riding for Disabled, organised by Ann on reception raised an amazing £221 throughout the hospital with staff buying tickets for the change to win a selection of prizes including lunch at Kettering Park Hotel for two and handmade chocolates.</p>

<p><strong>Joyce Griffin, a patient from Raunds recently had a ‘completely successful’ <a href="https://www.woodlandhospital.co.uk/treatments/orthopaedic-surgery/shoulder-and-elbow">rotator cuff repair on her shoulder</a> at Woodland Hospital with <a href="https://www.woodlandhospital.co.uk/specialist/orthopaedics/mr-bhavik-shah">Orthopaedic Consultant, Mr Shah</a> and has kindly shared her experiences of Woodland Hospital.</strong></p>
<p>She said ‘I'm delighted to confirm that everything has been outstanding.  Firstly, the operation itself was undertaken with great care and has been a complete success. I had quite a tear in my rotator-cuff muscle which was repaired with a row of double sutures and plastic screw into the Humerus. The scar on my shoulder is small and neat.’</p>
<p>‘Recovery, with careful demonstration from Nikki the physiotherapist made me feel confident that I wasn't going to cause problems for myself in carrying out the physio movements necessary for recovery.  In doing this, I recovered swiftly and within 14 weeks I regained full and complete motion in my shoulder and I am now pain free at last from both surgery and physio. Thank you to my excellent surgeon and also the excellent physiotherapy staff!’</p>
<p>‘The hospital accommodation was just right with an adequate sized bedroom, private bathroom, television and electric fan. Nursing staff called in regularly to check on me which was comforting. And there was of course a buzzer to call staff if needed.  The food was also quite adequate for NHS patients with choices of cereals and toast for breakfast and sandwiches for lunchtime.</p>
<p>Overall, I am feeling so delighted and forever grateful. What a brilliant team at Woodland Hospital and I would have no hesitation in recommending my friends and family. Thank you.’</p>

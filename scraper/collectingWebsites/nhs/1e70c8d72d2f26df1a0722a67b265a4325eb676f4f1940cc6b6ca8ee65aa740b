    &lt;Title&gt;22 month wait for gallbladder operation (still waiting)&lt;/Title&gt;
    &lt;ScreenName&gt;Charlie D&lt;/ScreenName&gt;
    &lt;CommentText&gt;In April 2018 I developed very unpleasant and persistent nausea. After a series of blood tests it was revealed in August that I had Hepatitis C. I assumed that this was causing the nausea.  
I couldn't get an appointment to see the specialist at the Gastroenterology Unit till December: treatment for the Hepatitis would start in the New Year. I felt very relieved. But some blood test results were lost and I didn't start the course until March. A routine blood test as part of the Hepatitis treatment revealed gallstones.  
All went well with the course, until two months later I told the nurse (who up to then had been great) that the nausea was still troubling me. They told me that this was a completely separate issue. I asked for it to be looked at, but was discharged back to my GP.  
Another two week wait, more blood tests; In August my GP referred me back to the Gastro unit urgently for the gallstones to be looked at. They were astonished I had been discharged. I wasn't given an appointment until December. During this time my nausea was getting slowly worse until in November I had horrible sickness and couldn't get out of bed.  
The GP sent me straight to A&amp;amp;E as an erupting gallstone can be very serious, even lethal. The staff on Juniper Ward were great, until four days later the surgical junior who discharged me told me I needed an urgent endoscopy. They tried to be helpful but didn't seem clear as to the date. They finally promised I was booked in for a Tuesday two weeks later. By the Monday afternoon I had not heard a word and had to go back to the ward and stand there, interrupting people, which I didn't like doing, to find out what was going on. It turned out that the specialist was on holiday that week, so why I was led to believe I would be treated then I don't know.  
When I was booked in two weeks after that, the surgeon couldn't access my gallbladder because of my hernia. I don't blame anyone for that.  
My notes were handed to Queen Elizabeth Hospital where a full surgical op was booked in for early February this year. This was cancelled. I'm now in position where I get sick very easily, (I've been off work this week with the nausea), not knowing whether I should check into A &amp;amp; E, not knowing how much longer I have to wait. It's very worrying and upsetting and I can't make any plans. I feel my concerns about the nausea were ignored. Although I of course understood that treating the Hep C was a priority nobody seemed interested in what my own priorities were. I have been given no detailed advice on diet. This has been going on for nearly two years. To say I'm fed up is an understatement.&lt;/CommentText&gt;

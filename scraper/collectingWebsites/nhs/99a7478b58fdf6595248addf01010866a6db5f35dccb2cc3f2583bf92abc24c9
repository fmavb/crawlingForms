    &lt;CommentText&gt;The Psychiatric liaison team in Salford Royal A&amp;amp;E department needs investigating because i find them to be rude and dismissive and not very helpful at all both me and my wife have brought our son in here on a few occasions for help he has complex mental health issues and has been turned away twice from this place the last time he was in a psychotic state scared both me and rest of family the strain and stress that all of us have been under because he has been turned away because apparently there is no beds available is unacceptable in this day and age. He has worked all of his life paid his taxes and when he needs help in his darkest hour he is turned away because there is no beds available I was stunned and angry hearing this and more so because of him being acknowledged as being ill but there being no beds available me and the rest of the family wouldn't have cared whether he was allocated a bed on other side of the country as long as he was put in to a hospital to be treated. We have all had to take time of work and take in turns looking after him in shifts which we shouldn't have to do which is disgusting. Also when someone is in a psychotic state being told to wait in a crowded A&amp;amp;E waiting room is unacceptable both me and my husband were having to control him in front of onlooking eyes from people watching and laughing and having their phones out for all we know they could have been filming him getting some sick kick out of it people in these states should have a separate waiting area whilst they are waiting which would reduce the stress and anxiety of both the persons who are in a crisis and the family who are their with them twice we have experienced this now from the psychiatric liaison team at Salford Royal now I am unhappy with this experience and will be going to see my MP about this because its unacceptable and disgusting. Considering there has been so much advance into Mental Health care and it is considered on the same level as Physical Health would someone who has cancer or Heart disease or a some other serious accident or other physical impairment be turned away and sent home I think not to me the Health care is still not treated the same way its be put out there on the news and by the Government and whats more upsetting is that its the same people working in the Mental health care that are doing this and not showing sympathy or compassion and showing no patience I feel sorry for people like my son who have mental health problems and are being treated the way they are in this day and age.&lt;/CommentText&gt;

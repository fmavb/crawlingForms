    &lt;Title&gt;It really is a bit hit and miss.&lt;/Title&gt;

    &lt;CommentText&gt;I attended the walk in centre last week for a cyst which had formed on my vulva - something which I suspected to be a bartholin's cyst. The first night I went I was seen by a lovely nurse who calmed me down, diagnosed my supposed bartholin's cyst, gave me some antibiotics and some advice for when it was appropriate to go back. The next day I was in absolute agony, and I had to call in sick for both a meeting and some hours which count towards my PGCE. I was having to waddle around as the cyst had gotten considerably bigger and extremely painful, and I was seen at the walk in centre within 1-2 hours again. However, the nurse who saw me was quite rude and assumed the answers to some the questions she was asking me in relation to medication etc. She then examined me without asking if I wanted a chaperone (I am ok with this normally, but I know some people find this uncomfortable), and then proceeded to tell me that she had seen 'worse and bigger cysts'. That really did not put me at ease as I was panicking about having to call in sick for more days on my PGCE, which is risky as I want to be able to pass it without having to worry about attendance. I merely asked if I could have it drained and she completely dismissed my question, and then ignored me when I started to panic and become upset. She did prescribe me some pain medication, but the experience was awful.

Fast forward about 24 hours- I was back home in Sheffield over the weekend, and 24 hours after I had seen this nurse, I become feverish and started to feel sick. I visited the walk in centre in Sheffield, I was diagnosed with a cyst on the labia INSTEAD of a bartholin's cyst, streamlined to the gynaecology ward, and had it drained all within 5 hours. The difference in care and how I was listened to and treated is very profound, and so I think that the walk in centre at Manchester is quite hit and miss ; I have had one good experience in the past, but this one has just been atrocious.&lt;/CommentText&gt;

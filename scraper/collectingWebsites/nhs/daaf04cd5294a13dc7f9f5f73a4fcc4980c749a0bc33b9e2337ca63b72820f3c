    &lt;Title&gt;Avoid A&amp;amp;amp;E like the plague&lt;/Title&gt;
    &lt;ScreenName&gt;Mike Caton&lt;/ScreenName&gt;
    &lt;CommentText&gt;I was taken to A&amp;amp;amp;E by ambulance after I injured my back exercising. The pain was so bad that morhine was given by the paramedics. The paraemdics were awelsome but I asked not be taken to the Q.E because of other difficult and unsaticefactory expereinces but had no choice but to go. 
I was not seen by a doctor for more than 9 hours. A polite young man arrived just before the end of his shift around 7:30 am letting me know that he would not be seeing this through. I had already worked out that the change happens at 8am and they were trying to appear like they had asessed me before the next shift arrived. I commented to my partner that nothing wil happen until the next shift arrived and that turned out to be true. He sent me for a X-Ray. The wrong type imaging for my injury and I explained this as I had not fallen or been in a collision. Of course x-rays only show broken bones which I knew I did not have. Around 12;00 another young doctor arrived. Who told me I had no broken bones and should leave. I asked for an MRI and was refused. I asked for a referral for an outpatient MRI and was refused. They said they do not do referrals for outpatients and only GP's do that. I challenegd this and they finally acknowleged that they do provide outpatient referrals such as to the fracture clinic but still refused. Eventually, the flustered, the 2nd year post doc student got the resgistrar who still refused an MRI but rewrote her prescription for better pain releif as I was still in agony. 
The whole expereince took over 12 hours and I still do not think I was properly assessed. Neither the junior doctors or registrar seemed to understand how I was injured and that I was. I spent 4 hours in a corridor and moved booth 3 times and lost once. The fact I managed to hobble to the toilet was eveidence that I could move and so discharged without treatment. This was when I was left alone on a stretcher at X-ray and could hold on no longer and the bathrrom was within crawling distance. 
The pain is excruciating and I have no hope that I will resolve this within NHS. 
My sense of this expereince is that the Xrays were used as an exclusion from treatment  and a way of proving that hey had done soemthing rather than nothing. I would have hoped that they could have offered a better assessment of the problem and referred for speclast care or assessment.  
In the end, asked them to reconsider, trying explain the feeling I was having  as was sat in agony unable to walk to the door but no. 
I write this this next morning, still in agony, laid out on the sofa trying to figure out how I can be helped.....&lt;/CommentText&gt;

    &lt;Title&gt;Overall Experience Poor.&lt;/Title&gt;
    &lt;ScreenName&gt;David&lt;/ScreenName&gt;
    &lt;CommentText&gt;On a Friday evening, in January 2020, after a GP recommendation, my sister and I attended the Kings Hospital A and E Department, with our 81-year-old mother for her to undergo tests for a possible stroke. None of us wanted to go, but to avoid a future possible &quot; we should have&quot; we went.

I suspect that the response to this feedback will be that the Department was busy, but my comments take this possible factor into account. I believe that I was polite and not pushy. I am listing my comments on our experience below (the positive ones first).

1) The ambulance team were impeccable in their service.
2) The Department carried out blood tests, blood pressure measurements and a head scan.
3) The final Dr provided us with a good consultation, apologised for the waiting time and was empathetic. 
4) We arrived at about 9 pm and left at 5.40 am - 8 hours 40 mins.
5) My mother was never given a bed/trolley bed but had to sit for the whole time.
6) The initial check-in took 1 3/4 hours - where my sister and I had to stand for most of it due to lack of chairs - there were only four chairs in this area. 
7) Two nurses and two A and E Department Managers would not or could not give us any details on the next stages, the possible further waiting times and what to expect next.
8) After 3 1/2 hours the 1st Department Manager said that she would ring the Head Scan Department for an update as to the progress for the scan but (in my view) took another hour to do so and later accepted that had been an error in the scan referral.
9) The scan was completed at the 6-hour stage, I asked a nurse and the manager for an indication as to the next stages and a time frame. The only response we received was to wait - they would not tell us of a time frame or possible further steps. 
10) I indicated to the nurse that my mother wanted to leave and asked if someone could remove the catheter from her arm. We were told to sit and wait for someone to attend to her. No once came to assist with this.
11) After 7 1/2 hours the nurse indicated from the reception desk that we were next in line.
12) After 8 hours, I spoke to the new Department Manager to ask that the catheter be taken out at the same time as seeing a Dr so as to avoid any further waiting. The manager told me that there we no longer an NHS A and E target of 4 hours, that I would have to wait and that I could take this issue up with my MP. At this point, all trust and confidence for me had gone.
13) We were seen by Dr about 20 minutes later - but before this I overheard the manager, referring to my mother, saying something like “what are we going to do with her”. 
14) We never received any sort of apology from the nurses or manager about the wait and no recognition of the requests I was making.

 My mother was at one-point vomiting, fatigued, distressed and disorientated.  My sister and I were tired and upset by the experience. 

I have not provided any names but I am willing to do so

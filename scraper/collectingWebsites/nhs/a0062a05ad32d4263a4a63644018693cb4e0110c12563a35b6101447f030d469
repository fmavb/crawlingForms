    &lt;Title&gt;An angel in a nurse's uniform&lt;/Title&gt;
    &lt;ScreenName&gt;Anonymous&lt;/ScreenName&gt;
    &lt;CommentText&gt;Within three quarters of an hour of arriving at mum’s house our nurse had everything ready to receive mum when she came home from hospital by ambulance and had put the family at ease with her cheerful and calmly confident approach. As soon as mum arrived she introduced herself to mum and swiftly gained her confidence by making absolutely sure that her transfer from stretcher to bed was accomplished swiftly and soon had her comfortably settled. 

She swiftly made friends with mum and the rest of the family and became an important part of our family; accepted, trusted, and held in high regard by all of us. This in itself was no mean feat as there were frequently more than twenty of us in the house at any one time. Her attitude remained positive throughout her stay with us and she supported the whole family during this traumatic time, often providing an ear to listen and a shoulder to cry on. She was alive to everyone’s feeling and moods and was able not only to help individuals, but also quietly let others know when someone was in distress, allowing us, in turn, to be far more supportive of each other than we may otherwise have been.  

Her care of and caring for mum was never less than exemplary and mum’s confidence in her was of the highest order, an opinion shared by the district nurses and other healthcare professionals who came into contact with her during her thirteen days of looking after mum. Nothing was too much trouble for her, regardless of whether she was on duty or not, day or night. Without this excellent nurse it is highly doubtful that our family could have coped with the care levels required and mum’s last days would have been considerably less comfortable.

I have heard it said that ‘Nurse’ is another word to describe a person strong enough to tolerate anything and soft enough to understand everyone. This certainly applies to our nurse who was the epitome of a competent, caring and compassionate professional. We were blessed to have her as mum’s nurse and our friend. Not all angels have wings, some of them have nurses uniforms.&lt;/CommentText&gt;

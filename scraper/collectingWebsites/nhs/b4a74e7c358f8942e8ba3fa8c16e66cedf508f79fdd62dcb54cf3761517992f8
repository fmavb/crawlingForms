    &lt;Title&gt;This was to be between myself and my doctor&lt;/Title&gt;
    &lt;ScreenName&gt;eaterxx58&lt;/ScreenName&gt;
    &lt;CommentText&gt;I found the service provided via Stepping Hill Hospital to be very efficient - my first appointment with my GP was in late February 2020 and I was referred to the hospital for further investigations. This appointment was within a week. I was told it would be within 2 weeks and to be seen just 4 days later was amazing.  
As I was concerned my symptoms may suggest cancer the quick service was majorly appreciated.  
Upon arriving at the hospital - Dermatology outpatient B building, I was greeted warmly and kindly and despite a fairly long queue to check in I was seen within 5 or 10 minutes and told to go to waiting room B. The waiting room was clean and comfortable.  
I was seen around 15 minutes after my given appointment time - not a problem, I had expected it to be a little longer so was pleasantly surprised. The nurse called my name and I entered a consultation room.  
Unfortunately, the nurse who saw to me really did upset me. As I am 20 years old, I was in a word, terrified of what my diagnosis may be, and I was told by this staff member that I had been brought in &quot;as you have suspected skin cancer&quot; and that the doctor needs to organise a treatment plan. I do not think this is something that should be said to a patient before any sort of formal diagnosis has been given. I appreciate this may have been a tactic of preparing me for the worst or maybe helping me to understand the potential severity of my symptoms, but I felt this was a discussion to be had between myself and my doctor.  
Hearing those words immediately upset me and I wasn't quite sure what the purpose of saying that to me was especially as I hadn't seen the doctor yet. I felt if I hadn't had a diagnosis why am I being told its 'suspected cancer and I need a treatment plan' this instantly caused concern and created a generally negative state of mind. It turns out my symptoms do not reflect cancer and was something fairly harmless but needed to get checked out further leading me to believe the comments by the nurse were completely unnecessary.  
Luckily, the doctor entered - whoever has asked me how it all went I have described this doctor as a 'ray of sunshine', immediately made me feel at ease, comfortable whilst remaining professional and informative. They really are an asset to your team, and I am sure this is not the first positive review.  
All in all, I had a positive experience using your service and I would like to thank you for treating me so well.  
I apologise for the negative comments regarding the nurse - I am sure it is something staff are told to say but I felt it could've been done in more subtle or gentle way.&lt;/CommentText&gt;

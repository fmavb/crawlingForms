I saw a GP and he recommended an MRI scan, via In-Health (who have a scanner nearby, in Stratford). I collected the form from Reception immediately. Over the weekend I decided that it might be quicker to consider paying privately if there was any significant delay. (The pain is debilitating and impeding my role as a carer for my husband.)

Mon 29 Jul	
I had two texts from In-Health in inviting me arrange an appointment. I went in online that afternoon to do this (as directed) The only appointments on offer were:
9th Aug at Waterloo; 10th Aug at Hornchurch; 11th Aug at Golders Green; 
(nothing near me at Stratford or Barking).  I logged off without accepting any of these and rang the local private facility  to find out about availability.  It was clearly going to be quicker to go private.

Tue 30 July.  
I obviously needed a new (open) referral. I visited my GP practice in person early in the morning. They set up a telephone consultation to a doctor.  She phoned me back very quickly and agreed to do a new referral.  I went over again to collect it that same morning. From there I went straight to the private hospital and set up an appointment for Fri 2 Aug first thing.

When I returned home I phoned In-Health to cancel the referral.  They confirmed the cancellation and thanked me for contacting them.

Despite this I received four more texts from them, inviting me to make an appointment. I assumed these would stop overnight when their system caught up.

Thu 1 Aug
Yet another text from In-Health (11.06) reminding me to make the appointment. In the afternoon I phoned them a second time. They apologised  profusely and said that my GP had sent TWO referrals (both for the same scan – I checked) But they would now cancel what they called ‘the second one’.

I later received yet another text reminder to make an appointment that evening.  But once again I assumed that their system would catch up overnight.

Fri 2 Aug
Having had the MRI in the morning I came home and at 13:44 a ninth text message arrived from In-Health about making an appointment. 
I completely lost my temper at this point. I phoned them and threatened a personal visit to Rochdale if they did not stop these texts immediately. By this point I was indeed rude, partly anger and partly physical pain.  They said no more would arrive.  (Instead they have said they will not accept any more referrals for me for anything) .  This is an appalling service.&lt;/CommentText&gt;

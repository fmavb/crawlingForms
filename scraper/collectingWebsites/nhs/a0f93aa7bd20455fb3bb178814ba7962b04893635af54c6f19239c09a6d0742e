    &lt;Title&gt;Ultra sound scan&lt;/Title&gt;
    &lt;ScreenName&gt;Adam&lt;/ScreenName&gt;
    &lt;CommentText&gt;My partner is 33 weeks and 2 days pregnant. Past couple of weeks baby has been very active, and all scans confirm baby is very healthy. Last night my partner said baby wasnt moving as often and when she did finally move, it was 'weak' movement.  Midwife was rang the following morning and was told to attend antenatal clinic. My partner and i immediately went to the hospital and straight away was greeted by friendly and professional midwives who really took care of my partner, making sure she was comfortable and happy. Even made her a cup of coffee ðŸ˜Š babys heartbeat was monitored and they confirmed that all was good but wanted to do an ultra sound scan to check growth, blood flow etc. Went to the fracture/ultrasound xray clinic on b1 and was told to wait a few minutes which is exactly how long we waited before being called in for my partners scan. The lady who did the scan was so nice and straight away made both my patner and myself feel really comfortable. She was great at her, knew exactly what she was doing and what she was looking for. The scan of our baby was amazing! There was so much detail it was unbelievable, we saw her pouting her lips, poking her tongue out and even moving her eyes. Again it was confirmed the baby was doing well, everything was normal. The position of baby made it hard for my partner to feel her kicks and wriggles. So.. you can probably guess that my partner and i feel so much better and just want to say a massive thankyou for everything the nhs do and an even bigger thankyou to janine muir who did my partners ultrasound scan, she went above and beyond today and you could literally see the passion she had for her job. Absolutely amazing person and a credit to the nhs. Theres so many great people, doing great things and their all undervalued and under appreciated, overworked and underpaid but yet still manage to put 100% into what they do. Thankyou.&lt;/CommentText&gt;

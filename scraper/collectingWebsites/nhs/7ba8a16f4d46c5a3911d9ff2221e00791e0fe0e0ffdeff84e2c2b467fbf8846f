    &lt;Title&gt;Prostatectomy&lt;/Title&gt;
    &lt;ScreenName&gt;Mike&lt;/ScreenName&gt;
    &lt;CommentText&gt;Early in 2020 it was discovered that I had prostate cancer.  Early in 2021 I have had the prostate removed and it has been a complete surgical success, so this is of course going to be a favorable review.  The early diagnostic work and Biopsy were not done at Stepping Hill   and my first contact with the hospital was in July for the pre-op and then the swab test. If you are not familiar with Stepping Hill, the campus, the car parking and signage can be confusing.   If possible take someone with you to read the map and instructions as you will be stressed;  allow plenty of time.

Considering all the hoops the staff and unseen admin had to go through in this Covid year they managed  the confusing experiences well and were calm and unflustered.

For the Prostatectomy I was welcomed into the building very early on Friday morning and walked through the separate entrance and Covid protocols and up to the isolated surgical wards.  The surgeon came round and explained what was going to happen and although I thought I was being very cool, I fainted during the explanation.  The operation over, the next 30 hours were spent recovering and getting used to the catheter, injections and the leg bag.     It all went so quickly that I found it difficult to take in all the info for when I had to leave.  Not being used to hospitals I was bowled over by how many bits have to come together to allow these complicated operations to happen at all let alone in a Covid year; I still feel though that time could be made for a little more hands on instruction before one is thrust from the total care of a hospital environment.  I can fault neither the help I did have nor the enthusiasm of all the staff.

I had to go back after a couple of weeks for the removal of the catheter and this was one of the happiest days of my life. Again friendly, patient help from the nurses until ...   it had worked! The catheter and the bag were gone and  I was almost completely dry – I don’t really know how the muscles/nerves function to make me so, but it has only got better with time.  The procedure is called ‘nerve sparing surgery’ and I think every nerve was spared.
 
I was very lucky.  I didn’t look anything up before I went in, but now realise that Stepping Hill is a world class centre of excellence for this type of robotic assisted surgery.  As well as the main man, I was attended by at least two other renowned surgeons and the care has been ongoing albeit by telephone.

I would certainly recommend Stepping Hill for this sort of operation.  Yes, the building is tired and crumbling, the basin in the ward toilet was non functional, car parking and finding your way is difficult but the actual surgery and ward experience is amazing.

    &lt;Title&gt;Poor communication and aggressive Dr&lt;/Title&gt;
    &lt;ScreenName&gt;Carol Winning&lt;/ScreenName&gt;
    &lt;CommentText&gt;My operation was scheduled for 18 June.  I attended TAU and waited from 7am until it was confirmed at 6pm that the op was cancelled.  I understood and I didn’t complain.  My op was rescheduled for  2 July. I was to be a day case but as there was possibility of complications I would recover post-theatre on a ward.  I was told (and it was put in a letter) that I would go to Sitwell Ward. However the ward was full.  I realise such things happen, and didn’t complain. They sent me to Surgical Admissions Unit- one of the busiest units in the hospital.  I was left on a TROLLEY!! which was hugely uncomfortable.  I had to get off it and sit in a chair. I have had this procedure before and I usually sleep off the GA over 4 or 5 hours.  No chance of that. The Unit was very busy and noisy.  Not the best circumstances in which to recover from an op!  Still I did not complain.  I understand how difficult it is when resources are stretched.  After a few hours The Unit contacted the Urology Team to ask about my discharge.  The Urology team denied I was their patient, they knew nothing about me!  Staff on the Unit asked me to confirm who I was under.  I did so and provided a letter with the details of the admission including the name of my Consultant.  An hour or so later, 2 Urology Drs came to the Unit.  My family had arrived at this point so we all heard the Dr arguing with the nurse saying they didn’t know about me and that I wasn’t their patient.  I stepped forward with my letter and informed the Dr who my Consultant was. I handed the letter over.  The senior Dr glanced at it then spoke very harshly to the nurse saying ‘This is an Outpatient’s appointment!  How has she got on here?’  THIS IS WHEN I BECAME ANGRY. I said firmly that it was NOT an Outpatients appointment, that I had been to theatre that morning and told them what I had done.  I suggested they check the notes. (Which, apparently everyone adds to but nobody ever reads).  The senior Dr came over and told me what op I had just had - dur!. Then they told me they did not know about me and had I been on the Day Ward I would have gone home already.  I asked why I wasn’t on the Day Ward.  I received an incoherent rambling response which I interpreted as ‘I don’t know’.  I suggested that maybe they didn’t 'know' about me, that I had been missed because I didn’t go back to Sitwell Ward as per the plan.  I wasn’t complaining - just offering up a possible explanation as they seemed very heated that ‘they didn’t know about me’. The Senior Dr then ranted on at me that my letter was incorrect and no one should have informed me I would go back to Sitwell as it was no longer a Urology Ward.  This Dr was very aggressive as though I was demanding something I shouldn’t. I was appalled by the treatment I was receiving and I was exhausted, so I interrupted the 'rant' and asked them to sign my discharge so I could get out of that horrible place. Considering the amount of paperwork done, communication is very, very poor&lt;/CommentText&gt;

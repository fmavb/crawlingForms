<div id="imageContenta05d3842e4e749f6b2eecbe305bbfae3">
</div>
<p>We are absolutely delighted to have won the 2019 British Institute of Radiology 'Make It Better' award for our work in making screening more accessible for women with learning disabilities.</p>
<p>Working in partnership with Surrey County Council Adult Social Care, Surrey &amp; Border Partnership NHS Foundation Trust Learning Disability Liaison Service and Surrey Choices who provide a range of support services to improve the independence, confidence and life skills of those with a range of disabilities, we aimed to improve awareness and attendance of the routine NHS breast screening invitation, by spending time with women with learning disabilities, carers and support organisations to understand the barriers to women attending their appointments.</p>
<p>Research showed that there was a particularly low uptake of these life-saving appointments among women with learning disabilities, so by working with GP practices and specialist LD teams, we implemented a flagging system to allow for a reasonably adjusted screening offer to be made. This included introducing an Accessible Information Standard (AIS) Notice Board that was displayed on-site, offering the option of information in an ‘accessible format’, easy read step by step guides to breast screening and staff receiving tailored training. A clinical and non-clinical ‘Learning Disability Champion’ was also nominated, supported by tailored information that created a better experience with screening staff. Reasonable adjustments such as extended appointment times were also offered to ensure sufficient time and resources were made available for women. Finally, carers and care workers were provided with more knowledge about the NHS Breast Screening Programme, giving them the tools to signpost women to those who could help.</p>
<p>As a result, the number of women with learning disabilities who attended their appointments increased from 50% in 2016/17 to 66.7% in 2017/18 – a 15% rise in appointment uptake.</p>

<div id="imageContent606257e67a5d442baad4554ab7260897">
</div>
<p>InHealth Endoscopy has become the first independent provider to deliver endoscopy services under the new “2 week wait” pathway.   The expanded service will support Oxfordshire CCG in their objectives to improve local access, bring care closer to home, improve cancer outcomes, reduce delays in diagnostic pathways and integrate care pathways between providers.  InHealth Endoscopy, which has been delivering services to the local population for over 5 years from a JAG accredited unit in Witney, plans to open 2 new locations in Oxfordshire by Spring 2018.</p>
<p>This expansion provides us with an opportunity to improve clinical outcomes which exceed the JAG and BSG requirements, and meet the latest standards for patient comfort, privacy and dignity</p>

    &lt;CommentText&gt;I arrived on Tuesday morning 24/9. The anaesthetist briefed me as well as the consultant surgeon. I felt very confident. As the general anaesthetic wore off I awoke in a busy room. Immediately I was made to feel at ease. Later I was moved to the ward where I stayed for two nights.

This is where I felt the patient care dropped off. The night nurses where very officious. I had a drain in my tummy that needed changing. I was made to feel that this was my fault as a mess on the bed had been created. To be honest I hadn’t even looked as I was getting my head around how uncomfortable I was feeling. The nurse changed my dressing and it hurt a lot when she did it. Again I was made to feel that my reaction was unacceptable. The following evening I asked to see sister and explained that I felt uncomfortable with the way that the nurse had handled me. Still the same nurse came in and changed my dressing. I asked if I could have morphine prior to her taking off and applying the new dressings. She did this but begrudgingly. When i said ouch the nurse said your going to feel some pain. I responded and asked if she could please be more gentle. I ensured that I was heard not only by the nurse but by the other patients around us.

Nobody enjoys staying in hospital. The Churchill hospital has been exceptional for my care. The consultants are brilliant. 

It is a real shame that the level of care for patients during the night shift should have dropped like this. I felt like I was being bullied. 

My illness and operation was major. There were others in the ward with me that were terminal. Being a nurse is a vocation. 99 percent of the team at The Oxford Churchill team are brilliant. 

When the sun goes down please don’t allow your patients to suffer. It’s not fair. Really it’s not fair - if you don’t enjoy your job then do something else - don’t bully your patients.&lt;/CommentText&gt;

    &lt;Title&gt;Confused/dismayed as disallowed transfer to pain clinic&lt;/Title&gt;
    &lt;ScreenName&gt;Anonymous&lt;/ScreenName&gt;
    &lt;CommentText&gt;Have been attending a pain clinic at  White Rose Sth Elmsall for several years.It closed DEC2018 and on request of my consultant I was told I would be transferred to Pontefract Pain Clinic under same Consultant. I received an appointment for January 2019 but this was then cancelled as inappropriate by Pontefract Pain Clinic. I was very ill at the time as I had just broken my leg/dislocated ankle/compound fracture/ORIF surgery for tri -melloral fracture and on ringing pain clininc was told something about needing to go to rheumatology  but 10months later no rheumatology appointment has been received. Instead I was sent to a private clinic miles away in Barnsley who wanted me to attend a 12 week course of 3 hour sessions on Tuesday afternoons for 'education' on Fibromyalgia management and for Cog. Behavioural Therapy....input that I have already received and attended in the past and do not need again re fibro. However, not to be negative I went along in my pot leg in my wheelchair for interview and was told there was nothing they could add to the course of  :education and CBT I had already been on yet I was still encouraged to join in the relaxation and exercise course. Not to be negative I agreed to do my best but  on the day of the course it was cancelled and when reinstated months later  it was on a Tuesday morning, the only day I could not attend as my carer/husband goes to the pain clinic/warfarin clinics so I cannot  go then. Time wasted for 6 months with chronic back pain and coccyx pain getting worse and they did not treat  chronic back pain/spondylolisthesis or advise on meds or anything that I actually needed.  I made a complaint to the company who agreed with me that this was an inappropriate referral by the NHS as I needed help with flared  Chronic Low Back Pain, Shoulder pain from using crutches and Coxyx pain due to being confined to a seat for 8 weeks. I also needed help with peripheral neuropothies/numbness in feet on standing/difficulty climbing stairs as discussed at my last pain clininc appointment Nov 2018. I have now bought  a stair lift. Despite contacting PALS and getting another referral for Ponte Pain Clinic I was told in August,  that I have to go back to the bottom of the waiting list for ten weeks and then this appointment too will likely  be cancelled because  I have a diagnosis of Fibromyalgia alongside the spondylolithessis/ back pain/coxyx pain so am back to rheumatology who diagnosed via MRI do not treat chronic back pain/spondylolithesis!!!!!. I have had to manage treating myself with ice and pain killers from GP for ten months at a time when my GP and I  feel  I needed my pain clinic input more than ever.GP is blocked from referring me!!. I have no idea what to do next to access my ongoing pain management/treatment and have once again contacted PALS for advice. They got back to me quickly and I explained as above and am awaiting for a response from Pain Clinic Pontefract..&lt;/CommentText&gt;

    &lt;Title&gt;Hospital birth (Royal Oldham) high risk&lt;/Title&gt;
    &lt;ScreenName&gt;Hana1234&lt;/ScreenName&gt;
    &lt;CommentText&gt;My birth went ok thankfully and the care was fine after my first birth was traumatic so I was grateful but I was horrified to see men staying with their partners overnight on the postnatal ward. Nobody warned me about this or informed me.  
First of all for religious reasons I cover in front of unrelated men and also it’s not allowed for me to sleep in close proximity to unrelated men due to safety. Especially as I did not have the option of having my partner on guard. I had an episiotomy so midwives would frequently check my stitches which gave me so much anxiety as the curtains never closed properly and the midwives kept opening them wide. Religious or not I expect to be free of the prying eyes of random men when I am in this position. I was very self conscious of breastfeeding -stress which I did not need! I was forever worrying about men hanging around right outside my cubicle with no care. They were tugging on my curtain, I was on my own and I was so scared someone would ‘accidentally’ barge in. They were also very noisy at night always on the phone late at night doing loud video calls and no staff member told them off for it.  
I could not have anyone with me as my husband had to be at home with our son. On the last night I managed to get him to stay as I needed him to watch over me so I felt safe. How ridiculous I should have felt safe without him!! Ironically we got ‘told off’ for having the light on (while we were trying to syringe feed the baby) we whispered the whole time so I found it odd that the many nights before it seemed like there was all night parties going on no but no staff had any issue but the night I reluctantly got my partner in to ‘keep watch’ to make me feel safe and my baby also needed help with feeding, we get told off for having a light on. You couldn’t make it up.  
I also did not like that these men did not use the visitor toilet but they normal ones, I would often have to wait whilst I was soaked in blood.  
I did mention this to my health visitor who was most sympathetic. I should not have been worrying about being watched by men. Each time I went to the toilet I felt like I had an audience. Other women don’t stare I just had this issue with men.  
I just don’t know how men who don’t even have a dBS check were allowed feet away from my baby who I had to leave alone while I went to the toilet. This wouldn’t be allowed on any other ward so why on ward in women only area?!. I have no issue with male staff I trust they are professional and have DBS checks done: I know nothing about these random men and I am disgusted this is now allowed and women like me have no choice but to accept it.  
I am thinking of trying for another baby but the thought of sharing the ward fills me with so much dread and there is no option for a side room. I am high risk so a home birth would be pointless but I am filled with so much panic when I think of sharing a ward with strange men while I’m at my most vulnerable and when I will be mostly uncovered and showing and discussing intimate parts of my body.  
Now that I’m thinking about trying for my third the feelings I managed to ignore have resurfaced and I honestly don’t know what to do next time. I feel like I would have to discharge myself against medical advice. I feel I would have to put myself at risk and give birth at home despite being so high risk and my babies being born low birth weight and need monitoring. It would be good if someone could contact me to let me know my options next time&lt;/CommentText&gt;

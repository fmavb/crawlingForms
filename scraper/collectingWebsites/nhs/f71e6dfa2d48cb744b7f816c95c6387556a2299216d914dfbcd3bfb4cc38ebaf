<p><strong>What is liaison psychiatry?</strong></p>
<p>It has long been known that there is interaction between the body and the mind.  Liaison psychiatry is the specialty of psychiatry that deals with this relationship, and the link between people’s physical and mental health.</p>
<p>Like most liaison psychiatry services, our liaison teams are based within general hospitals and also in a specialised cancer hospital. (Some of our teams have slightly different names, such as Mental Health Liaison or Psychological Medicine teams). </p>
<p>We have teams based in:</p>
<ul>
<li class="first">Macclesfield District General Hospital</li>
<li>Leighton Hospital, Crewe</li>
<li>Countess of Chester Hospital</li>
<li>Arrowe Park Hospital (Wirral University Teaching Hospitals)</li>
<li class="last">Clatterbridge Cancer Centre</li>
</ul>
<p>The liaison teams work closely with other doctors and healthcare workers to ensure that your physical and mental health care are as joined up as possible.  You might be interested in viewing a <a href="https://vimeo.com/98629035.">liaison psychiatry video</a>, courtesy of CNWL NHS Foundation Trust.</p>
<p><strong>Who works in the liaison teams?</strong></p>
<p>Our liaison psychiatry teams include:</p>
<ul>
<li class="first">Mental health nurses</li>
<li>Mental health social workers</li>
<li>Psychiatrists (doctors who have specialised in psychiatry)</li>
<li>Counsellors (in Clatterbridge Cancer Centre)</li>
<li class="last">Administrative staff</li>
</ul>
<p>CWP’s liaison teams are amongst the most experienced and well established in the country. Several of the teams have been accredited by the Psychiatric Liaison Accreditation Network <a href="http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/arrowe final (3).pdf">(PLAN)</a> of the Royal College of Psychiatrists as being “Excellent.” Using our different backgrounds and training, we work together to try and provide holistic care</p>

<h3>Things you should know</h3>
<p>Who is referred to liaison psychiatry?<br/><br/>People are referred when the health professionals looking after their physical care think that assessment or treatment by a liaison psychiatry team may help with a physical or mental health problem. Psychological problems are more common in people who have physical illnesses. We also know that if we help with the psychological side of things, the physical problems are more likely to improve. Therefore it makes sense to try and address all the issues, rather than just one or the other. <br/><br/>What sorts of problems do liaison psychiatry teams deal with?<br/><br/>Liaison psychiatry services see people with a wide range of problems. These include<br/><br/>difficulties coping with a physical illness<br/>anxiety and depression<br/>confusion and memory problems<br/>problems with drinking or drugs<br/>self-harm<br/>medically unexplained physical symptoms, which can sometimes be helped by a psychological as well as a physical approach.<br/>As well as seeing patients face to face, we are involved in raising awareness, education and training of our medical colleagues/staff in acute hospital about mental health conditions. We work with them to develop policies to promote the needs of patients with mental health symptoms presenting to general hospitals.<br/><br/>The team also works alongside medical colleagues in coordinating assessment and treatment of older adults admitted with confusion, dementia and depression. The team provides education to medical staff and to people in general to increase awareness about dementia care. The Arrowe Park liaison team have produced a video towards increasing awareness about dementia which can be viewed on Royal College of Psychiatrists website and YouTube.<br/><br/>What do the team do?<br/><br/>Liaison psychiatry  teams see patients on wards, in emergency departments and in out-patient clinics.  We offer a detailed assessment of emotional, psychological and social needs.  Time is provided to discuss problems with a mental health practitioner (a nurse, social worker or a doctor). Patients may bring a carer or relative with them if they wish.<br/><br/>Together with the patient, we work through what further help may be needed and draw up a care plan. We aim to understand the situation and difficulties in a holistic manner. The care plan may mean referring for counselling, to another specialist team or possible admission to hospital if needed.  Medication may be prescribed if indicated.  If so, we  will take into account how these medicines might interact with physical illness or other medications being taken.<br/><br/>We will also inform GP of the agreed care plan and liaise with other professionals where appropriate with the patient’s permission.</p>

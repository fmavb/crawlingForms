    &lt;Title&gt;Great experience&lt;/Title&gt;

    &lt;CommentText&gt;Our birthing experience started at 7am Thursday 23rd April.  I was taken and given a bed whilst having all the checks, speaking to the cesarean team, whilst my husband waited at home. Soon around 9am he was called in and we were excitedly going to theatre. Just before the spinal block an emergency was called to theatre. We got taken to our labour room (empty) and told to wait. We completly understood as our previous girl had been an alarm bell emergency so we were fully prepared to wait for those in a more important situation. Thursday was a busy day and 7 hours later, after being NIL by mouth for 17 hours and 4 hours with no water I just wanted to go home and come back when they were ready. I was feeling sad and just wanted to go. Despite being Completely busy the midwife team saw that I had been sitting on a visitors chair for 6 hours and couldn't apologise enough. She seemed horrified! They got my bed and told us the team (theatre team that had worked all day) had confirmed they would stay on working so our wait wouldn't be in vain. We were beyond grateful, and despite working flat out all day they even clapped us on re-entry!

The section was very calm and clear and controlled. We got wonderful skin to skin afterwards. Like I, my husband had a fantastic experience. He was able to take pictures and be close to me for everything from the spinal block (which they had to redo) to the operation. The team have a wonderful sense of humour and made it an experience we will never forget for all the right reasons.  After a traumatizing first birth we particularly appreciated this bit. 

Recovery was good. It is to be expected- busy ward -lots of rotating staff - strict and necessary proceedures (PPE). But each Member of staff tried to understand us as indivuduals and nothing was too much an ask. Breast feeding was SO supportive and has given me bags of confidence. 

Had him at 17:39 Thursday went home 10:30 Saturday. Thankyou to such a wonderful team of skilled professionals. We were in our own bubble during our time at Musgrove and never felt like we were in the middle of a pandemic.  &lt;/CommentText&gt;

    &lt;Title&gt;excellent care but slight bitter taste&lt;/Title&gt;

    &lt;CommentText&gt;I came in to RPH via A&amp;amp;amp;E. The ambulance crew were amazing. Very attentive and made me feel at ease despite my condition/pain.  The A&amp;amp;amp;E department were very busy and I was left on a trolley in the isle for a few hours, but that was understandable due to the high demand.  I was transferred to MAU for overnight stay at  approx 10pm and was treated with respect and dignity. The staff were very busy and my painkillers (other tablets) were somewhat slow in being dispensed, and was told it was because of  “staff handover to the night shift”.  I was woken at about 2am to be given the tablets.  In the morning I was to be taken to have an MRI. The porter arrived with a wheelchair at about 12:30pm.  I informed him that I was feeling dizzy and requested that he take it slow due to “peripheral vertigo”.  His rather pathetic and dismissive response was “huh? vertigo? thats a fear of heights!”  I replied, “what ever you call it, just take it slow and steady please”.  This he completely ignored and made nil effort to make the movements slow or steady. The wheelchair was moved forward and backwards (in jerking type moves) a number of times in the lift and again in the MRI area without one bit of concern for my well being. He parked the wheelchair and left without even asking if I was ok. I was not ok, and had to shout for a passing nurse to aid me with a sick bowl.  I mentioned to the nurse how I was treated and she said she was appalled and would ensure the second porter would be more helpful.  This I must say he was. He was very considerate and understanding. In the evening I was discharged and I returned home. I was very happy with the care in the main, except a bitter taste left by the first porter who could have been in a rush to avoid the cafeti&amp;amp;#232;re from closing for lunch!! (or are they targeted on kpi’s which promote speed at the expense of compassion and care?)&lt;/CommentText&gt;

<p>Stepping Hill Hospital’s stroke centre in Stockport has been rated as the best in the country.</p>
<p>The latest independent quarterly report from the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme (SSNAP) is the single source of stroke data for England, and rates the quality and performance of services for every stroke patient, from treatment to recovery. The report is produced by the Royal College of Physicians in collaboration with stroke clinicians, researchers and patient representatives, and examines all main aspects of stroke care.</p>
<p>In the new report, Stepping Hill Hospital came top in England out of a total of 224 routinely admitting acute stroke teams (those which admit the majority of stroke patients directly for acute stroke care) between April and June 2018. It had previously been rated first in an SSNAP report last year, and has now returned to the top position.</p>
<p>The hospital’s stroke centre has two wards, and assesses over 3000 patients with suspected stroke and treats over 1100 stroke patients a year. It is one of only three specialist units in Greater Manchester and expanded its services four years ago. The unit treats patients from Eastern Cheshire, as well as Greater Manchester.</p>
<p>Strokes are the fourth biggest killer in the UK, and a leading cause of disability – but swift, specialist treatment can make a huge difference. There are more than 100,000 strokes in the UK each year with someone suffering from one every five minutes.</p>
<p>The Stepping Hill stroke centre uses high tech scanners to detect blood clots in the brain, and then emergency `clot-busting` drugs to break them down. It also provides stroke patients with a full rehabilitation programme, with a team of physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists working alongside stroke doctors and nurses.</p>
<p>The centre includes a dedicated assessment unit for stroke patients in the emergency department, hyperacute stroke unit , physiotherapy gym, sensory garden therapy rooms, and a specialist unit specifically for the assessment of TIAs (or ‘mini strokes.’)</p>
<p>Patients have ranged in age from 21 to 104, with the average patient staying on the unit for 22 days.</p>
<p>One patient satisfied with the care he received is Brian Ahern from Offerton in Stockport. Brian, 81, is a retired master butcher, furnace operator and journalist, and is married to Beryl with three children, six grandchildren and seven great grandchildren. Brian had a stroke several months ago, and was taken to Stepping Hill Hospital’s A&amp;E before being transferred to the unit, where he made his recovery.</p>
<p>Brian said: “The care received since I had my stroke was great. It’s like a home from home at the unit; all the staff form a good association with you, they’re always there with a smile. It’s what you need during difficult times.”</p>
<p>Following his recovery on the unit Brian is now back home with his family.</p>
<p>Dr Srinath Meadipudi, clinical director for stroke services at the hospital said; "We are very proud to receive this confirmation that we are providing some of the very best quality care for stroke patients in the country.</p>
<p>This assessment is a testament to the dedication and teamwork of all the different staff groups on the unit who work together to give our patients the best possible support and chance of recovery.</p>
<p>We will continue to do our uppermost to ensure our standards remain high.” </p>

<h4 id="Article-195992">Faster fracture care with virtual clinic</h4>

<p>Patients at Stepping Hill Hospital are getting more specialist and faster care for broken bones thanks to an innovative new service.</p>
<p>The ‘virtual fracture clinic’ means that appropriate patients can receive the help and advice they need without unnecessary follow-up appointments at the hospital, while those with more complex fractures can see a specialist doctor sooner.</p>
<p>Traditionally patients suffering suspected fractures attend A&amp;E for an x-ray and initial treatment and then, assuming there is a break, all of them return to the fracture clinic for assessment by a doctor, who will decide if they need specialist treatment or can be discharged.</p>
<p>Stepping Hill treats around 140 new patients every week for broken bones. There is a lot of demand on the fracture clinic service and patients can often face lengthy waits before they are seen by a doctor, who may only need to give advice on how the patient can care for the fracture themselves at home.</p>
<p>In the new seven day service, all patient x-rays and notes from A&amp;E attendances are examined and reviewed virtually by an orthopaedic consultant within 24 hours. Where appropriate, patients are then contacted by telephone and provided with further written advice and guidance on how to manage their fracture, without the need for an appointment.</p>
<p>There has been a 25% reduction in unnecessary fracture clinic appointments since the new service started three months ago; reducing waiting times, as well as less crowding in the clinic and reduced costs. Patients getting a ‘virtual’ follow-up appointment, as well as those seeing an orthopaedic consultant for their follow-up, now receive their first follow-up treatment plan within approximately 2-4 days instead of 4-7 days.</p>
<p>Paul Wake is a father whose young son was seen by the virtual clinic. “I was really impressed with the care my son received from Stepping Hill emergency department; a broken wrist which was fixed up in under two hours by a fantastic team. The virtual fracture clinic wasn`t something I`d heard of but it was explained to me while we were at the emergency department and we were called with follow-up information within 48 hours. The service certainly seems to make sense, and I can see the benefits to both patients and the NHS and reducing stress for patients like my son.”</p>
<p>Orthopaedic consultant Steve Royle said, “Technology means that senior doctors now have the information they need about a patient’s injury and their X-rays at their fingertips without a patient needing to attend hospital for this assessment.”</p>
<p>“For more serious fractures, face-to-face consultations are still the best option, but in other cases the virtual solution is better for both the patient and the clinic. It is a safe, proven way to help patients with certain injuries and avoids unnecessary appointments, provides faster care and information to the patient, and cuts waiting times for those that do need appointments.”</p>
<p>“A lot of patients think its brilliant and are happy not to have to travel to hospital. But if a patient has any concerns we will always offer them a face to face appointment if they wish.”</p>

<p>A mum from Offerton in Stockport has said goodbye to a life of pain as she trains for her next half marathon, thanks to a new specialist operation at Stepping Hill Hospital.</p>
<p>Kerry Bentley, 46, had suffered from severe back problems for several years. She had two slipped discs, osteoarthritis and had a constant severe pain in the left hand side of her lower back.</p>
<p>Kerry had been working as a civil servant, and a full family life with husband Will and children, Mollie and Oscar (now 19 and 9.) but the pain she had to contend with was unbearable at times.</p>
<p>She was unable to tie shoelaces, pick up young Oscar, brush her teeth without having to hold onto the basin, and many other simple tasks. Sleeping was very difficult too. Kerry’s back was taking a hard toll on her life.</p>
<p>Mr Vineet Tandon, Kerry’s surgical consultant at Stepping Hill Hospital tried a number of methods to ease her pain, including epidurals and steroid injections, but nothing seemed to work.</p>
<p>In 2015 as a result of further diagnostic testing it was identified that Kerry had a problem with her ‘SI joint’, which joins the lower spine and pelvis, she became eligible for an innovative new procedure carried out at the hospital – the ‘i-Fuse method’.</p>
<p>The iFuse method inserts three small titanium implants across the SI joint, and is designed to stabilise and fuse the SI joint.</p>
<p>In January 2016, Kerry became one of the very first patients in Stockport to undergo the iFuse treatment, carried out by Vineet Tandon and his surgical team.</p>
<p>Kerry said, “The effect was dramatic and as soon as I woke up from surgery I could feel the difference as the joint felt stable. That night I had the best night’s sleep in years. I was virtually pain free overnight ”</p>
<p>With the help of both hospital physiotherapists, and exercises arranged through her local GP surgery, Kerry’s recovery was soon complete.</p>
<p>Mr Vineet Tandon said, “Kerry was in constant pain which was having a debilitating effect on her life, and the iFuse procedure was the ideal way to solve her problem. The procedure is minimally invasive and is therefore safer, with a much quicker recovery time, than previous methods.”</p>
<p>Feeling much fitter and healthier, Kerry decided to take up running and ran her first 5K parkrun at Woodbank Park in Offerton on 04 May 2017. She continued to increase her distance and together with husband Will, Kerry ran her first half marathon in October last year, completing the 13.1 miles in 2 hours 16 minutes. She completed a second half trail marathon last month in 2 hours 17 minutes and has had her place confirmed to run the Manchester half marathon on 20 May 2018 to raise funds for the local charity, The Wellsprings. She also plans to run a full marathon next year.</p>
<p>Kerry said, “It’s such an amazing feeling being able to run for miles when just a couple of years ago it was not even an option.</p>
<p>"The effect on my life has been incredible. Mr Tandon and the whole team were so supportive right through the whole process. I can never thank them enough. I hope they go on to help many more people the way they have done for me.”</p>

<p>Stepping Hill Hospital’s stroke centre in Stockport has been officially ranked as the best in the country.</p>
<p>The independent report from the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme (SSNAP) rates the quality and performance of services for every stroke patient, from treatment to recovery. It is the single source of stroke data for England.</p>
<p>Stepping Hill Hospital came first in the country out of a total of 224 stroke centres. It shows a big improvement for the hospital, leaping up the national rankings by 50 places over the past eighteen months. Stepping Hill Hospital’s stroke centre assesses over 3000 patients with suspected stroke and treats over 1100 stroke patients a year. It is one of only three specialist units in Greater Manchester and expanded its services three years ago. The unit treats patients from the High Peak and Eastern Cheshire, as well as Greater Manchester.</p>
<p>Strokes are the fourth biggest killer in the UK, and a leading cause of disability – but swift, specialist treatment can make a huge difference. There are more than 100,000 strokes in the UK, with someone suffering from one every five minutes. In Greater Manchester the number is 6000 every year. The Stepping Hill stroke centre uses high tech scanners to detect blood clots in the brain, and then emergency `clot-busting` drugs to break them down.

<p>The centre includes a dedicated assessment unit for stroke patients in the emergency department, hyperacute stroke unit , physiotherapy gym, therapy rooms, sensory garden and new unit specifically for assessment of ‘mini-strokes’.</p>
<p>Patients have ranged in age from 21 to 104, with the average patient staying on the unit for 22 days.</p>
<p>Roy Miller (76) from New Mills in the High Peak, Derbyshire is currently recovering at Stepping Hill Hospital following a stroke several weeks ago. He is making good progress and said, “Having a stroke is very frightening, but the support and reassurance I have had from all the staff here has been a huge help. It’s certainly very good to know this is the best stroke unit in England, and to be honest it doesn’t surprise me. The care they have given me, doing their very best to help me to recover, has really been fantastic.”</p>
<p>Dr Shivakumar Krishnamoorthy, clinical director for stroke services at the hospital said, "We`re really proud and delighted with this gold standard assessment of our services. Having access to the right tests and treatments immediately; such as the CT scans, clot busting drug, and specialist stroke therapy, means that stroke patients have a much better chance of recovery.</p>
<p>"Everything we do is about ensuring we provide the highest quality of care for our patients and this achievement is testimonial to the teamwork and dedication of all the staff involved.</p>
<p>Ann Barnes, chief executive of Stockport NHS Foundation Trust, which runs Stepping Hill Hospital, said, "We are immensely proud of our services and this top ranking is testament to the skill and commitment of all our staff, as well as the investment we have made.</p>
<p>“Our stroke centre seamlessly sews together all aspects of care; bringing experts and equipment under one roof to provide first-class treatment, reducing death rates and long-term disability”.</p>

<img alt="Patient David Kick and advanced nurse practitioner Johanna Wilkinson" border="0" id="ctl00_ctl00_ctl00_PlaceHolderMain_column1Content_column1Content_ArticleListModule_ArticlesRepeater_ctl04_ctl00_ArticleImage_DisplayImage" src="/Services/UserControls/UploadHandlers/MediaServerHandler.ashx?id=186488"/>

<p>Stepping Hill Hospital is now carrying out a specialist form of neck surgery to provide swifter treatment for patients with spinal cord or nerve compression.</p>
<p>The neck surgery, which is medically referred to as cervical spine or C-spine surgery, involves the removal of discs, ligaments or bones to treat these disabling conditions. They can be caused by slipped discs pressing on the nerves which can cause arm pain, or directly on to the spinal cord. This can cause people to become unsteady and fall over, and in severe cases, even paralysis.</p>
<p>In the Greater Manchester region, this specialist surgery was previously only available at Salford Royal Hospital. Stepping Hill Hospital is only the second hospital in the area to perform these operations.</p>
<p>This surgery can also be carried out as an emergency in patients with neck injuries, cancer or infections. David Kick, a 56 year old HGV driver from Offerton in Stockport was rushed to hospital with a neck abscess, which is a deep neck infection which can often be fatal. Unknowingly he had developed diabetes, which was uncontrolled, and this had led to the severe infection.</p>
<p>When David arrived at Stepping Hill Hospital he was unable to move his arms or legs and had septicaemia, a life-threatening blood infection. He was rushed from the hospital’s A&amp;E and acute medical unit for an emergency neck (C-spine) operation to drain the abscess and another abscess was drained from his leg. With a longer delay he may not have survived.</p>
<p>David was in intensive care for ten days, but is now recovering well on the hospital’s spinal ward. He will soon be moving to their off-site Devonshire Unit, but is now walking again and hopes to be up and about for his son’s wedding in June.</p>
<p>David said, “I’m so grateful that Stepping Hill Hospital now does this surgery, as it’s made all the difference for me. I’ve been here eight weeks and the care I’ve had from all the staff has been extraordinary.’</p>
<p>The C-spine surgery is carried out by a team led by surgeon Mr Parmjit Sian.</p>
<p>Mr Sian explains “The fact that we can now carry out this surgery at Stepping Hill Hospital can mean the difference between life and death for a patient like David. It is complex surgery as the cervical spine contains seven bones, known as vertebrae. These bones are stacked on top of one another and linked by discs, ligaments, and muscles which surround the spinal cord and nerves. “</p>
<p>“The surgical goal is to restore spinal stability and create some room for the spinal cord and nerves. Patients generally have a good recovery and eventually can return to activities of daily living.”</p>

<p>Recent statistics confirm that Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport is delivering some of the most successful and safest bowel cancer treatment in the country.</p>
<p>The National Bowel Cancer Audit, which is published nationally, shows high survival rates for bowel cancer patients who undergo surgery and treatment at Stepping Hill Hospital.</p>
<p>The 90 day mortality figures for patients treated by Stepping Hill is 1.9%, well below the national average of 3.6%, and among the top ratings in the country. The two year mortality figure is 13.8%; again much lower than the national average and the lowest rating in the north west.</p>
<p>The audit follows a NHS England report, in October 2016, which ranked Stockport as the 7<sup>th</sup> best area in England for cancer treatment in terms of prompt diagnosis and treatment, one-year survival rates and the overall patient experience. It also follows 100% satisfaction rates for the hospital’s cancer outpatient services in the Friends and Family Test.</p>
<p>Despite moves to increase the early diagnosis of bowel cancer about 30% of patients have to have treatment as an emergency. The recent National Emergency Laparotomy Audit (NELA) audit looking at emergency surgery showed that Stepping Hill was in the top 10 for safety in the country and second only to Bristol University for large units.</p>
<p>Bowel cancer is the most common cancer in non-smokers and second most common cause of death from cancer.  Over 40,000 people in the UK are diagnosed with bowel cancer each year, that’s around 110 people every day. </p>
<p>Stepping Hill treats around 200 bowel cancer patients each year, with cases being similar to other hospitals in terms of complexity and risk. It has a specialist bowel cancer team which includes surgeons, oncologists, cancer nurses and stoma therapists, as well as state-of–the-art critical care facilities. This ensures each patient has the highest quality advice, support and care throughout their time with the hospital.</p>
<p>Ed Clark, a consultant surgeon at Stepping Hill Hospital, who specialises in bowel cancer, said, “Surgery is the main curative treatment for bowel cancer and we are delighted that this independent audit confirms the high quality and safety of our care.</p>
<p>“The whole team is constantly striving to improve our care and results as well as staying up to date with the latest technology. Over the last few years we were the first in Manchester to introduce new techniques for both advanced and early rectal cancer.</p>
<p>For patients to know how safe it is for them to come to this hospital is a huge message and it's a great tribute to the team here. Our results are constantly improving thanks to the multi-disciplinary team work and improved post-operative care. Having cancer surgery is always a stressful experience, but patients at Stepping Hill can be assured that they are in the very best hands.”</p>

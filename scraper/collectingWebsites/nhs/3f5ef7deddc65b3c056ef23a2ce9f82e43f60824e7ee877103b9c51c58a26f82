    &lt;Title&gt;Audiology - no one willing to help&lt;/Title&gt;
    &lt;ScreenName&gt;Anonymous&lt;/ScreenName&gt;
    &lt;CommentText&gt;First of all I must stress that I am profoundly deaf. I wear two hearing aids and rely on lip reading. I'm a busy mum or three young children.

I attended the Wednesday drop in session as I wasn't hearing well and my hearing aid isn't working sufficiently. 

I was told by the audiologist that the hearing aid wasn't suitable for me but that they couldn't change it as my ears was blocked of wax. I was told to ring the Treatment Room and book an appointment then ring back Audiology, who will conduct a hearing test that is long outstanding. 

I was given a slip of paper to ring the Treatment Room at the Heaton Moor Clinic for my ears to be syringed.

I phoned them and was scheduled an appointment for in two weeks time. I then rang Audiology who booked me an appointment for the week later to have a hearing test. 

On arriving at the Treatment Room I was told I couldn't have ears syringed because I had grommets fitted as a child. I must stress I have had my ears syringed using water many times in my adult hood - by GPs! 

So I was turned away and sat in the car in tears as I can't hear. My husband rang ENT who told him I had to ring GP to be re-referred. 

My GP put in a rapid referral and it is Heaton Moor who sort the appointments and I received a letter yesterday for an appointment for next week at Withington Hospital at 9am! I live in Stockport, my husband works and I don't drive and I have three children to get to school at that time! 

My husband phoned up Heaton Moor who rang Audiology to see if they could fit me in at Stepping Hill and Heaton Moor rang him back. They said that ENT/Audiology had advised I go to A&amp;amp;amp;E to have my ears cleaned out!

With the A&amp;amp;amp;E department struggling to deal with the sheer influx of patients, I'm disgusted they think A&amp;amp;amp;E is the place to go to have ears suctioned! I strongly advise management to act upon this advice being given! 

Audiology also cancelled my appointment for hearing test and made out I had cancelled it which I didn't as I wanted to go so I could at least communicate with someone face to face..

My GP has had to do a new referral and I have been told to ring Friday to see where my referral is up to. 

To leave someone profoundly deaf without hearing aids working for over a month and tell them to go to A&amp;amp;amp;E is shocking.

I am going to be taking this matter further.&lt;/CommentText&gt;

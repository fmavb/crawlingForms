    &lt;CommentText&gt;I  was astonished to read recently that Cleveland had been closed for a day recently by the care quality commission due to anxieties over competence.  I am therefore writing to give the views of myself and my husband John, both patients.  We have been treated with unfailing helpfulness by the reception staff and all our requests without exception dealt with most courteously and competently.  Our named doctor is without doubt an exceptional GP in whom we place total trust.  He is a careful listener.  He deals with every problem we bring to him with a kindly and reassuring competence.  He is the first doctor we have had who will ring us at home when he knows we are worried about a medical problem and will visit us the same day if there is some urgency.  We have never felt that we couldn't bring any medical problem to him for either an instant solution or referral on a consultant if appropriate.  He is simply an outstandingly good GP.  My husband has also been seen by another doctor, for keratosis surgery, where again we were entirely pleased with the procedure, treatment and outcome.  I have also seen another doctor who literally transformed my life by finding a statin which not only did not make me feel sick as had two other statins, but also stopped the constant diarrhea which I had endured for several years following extensive bowel surgery. We have both been treated by various nurses at Cleveland who have all been caring and competent eg. one nurse has just recently de-waxed both my and John's ears successfully. In short, we have never had a 'bad' visit to Cleveland Surgery and would be devastated if this surgery with all its hardworking and competent kindly staff were to close.  My husband had recently suffered a bad fall, and through our surgery we have been put in touch with many helpful agencies (eg. Wellbeing Lincolnshire, MAMS, etc), and he has subsequently been diagnosed with vascular  dementia, and throughout we have been supported totally by our doctor through his kind helpfulness and knowledgeable competence.   I find it hard to believe that the level of care we have been offered is not freely offered to all patients at this surgery and am astonished to hear that the surgery had been closed for a day due to some alleged lack of safety, as this is so far away from our experiences over many years.&lt;/CommentText&gt;

    &lt;CommentText&gt;Well we’re do I begin as a tax payer who never uses the service I expect when I do they treat me but they didnt even offer me a paracetamol. I entered the hospital around 1.15 on Saturday 2nd of February. I saw the triage nurse at around 2.20 who made the wrong choice and said I need to see the gp in the hospital even though I couldn’t swallow my own saliva and hadn’t eat or drank water for two days as it was physically impossible so I waited another two hours to see gp said I shouldn’t even be seeing her this is for a n e consultant so I had to wait to see him in the freeze cold waiting room for another 30 mins for him to ask me what’s wrong when I said it difficult to speak please read my note consultant was being a awkward anyway re explained myself I was then asked to go to the waiting room for the consultant to read upon this so waited another 20 mins consultant came back and said we can’t do a thing here for you no ent here you need to go Doncaster I said no you haven’t offer me anything for pain or hydration no iv drip nothing I was curled over in barle unable to walk blurry vision no balance stiff neck shaking pins and needles all over my body consultant like wait for me to sort somthing. Wait 20 mins freezing cold room comes back to me saying it’s up to u if u wana go make ur own way the consultant actually said that make your own way we have done everything possible for you I was like you haven’t done anything but wast my time and make me deteriorate further  consultant said I have done everything for you not it’s up to you now . What have you done other then freeze me to death. So wait longer for for them to make me a letter and gave me that when it suited them didnt explain where I needed to go in the hospital in Doncaster  said go to a n e which was wrong I had to pay for a taxi as my mum had my 2 year old n hospital said no to transport even though I cudnt even stand up. When got here thanks to them I was in the complete wrong place  so had to wait further 3 hours to be seen but at least they have treated me my bp at Rothetham was 91 over 60 they didn’t care my pulse was low they didn’t care no hydration just because they cudnt be bothered n did want do get a bed dirty. They could of at least given me an iv drip I was confused out of it in excruciating pain unable to stand up curled over high fever no pain relief. I pay all my taxes i used the hospital four years ago previous to that I used the hospital at the age of 10 for ear operation I didnt even give birth to my daughter there as I was to scared.&lt;/CommentText&gt;

    &lt;Title&gt;Disappointed this time&lt;/Title&gt;

    &lt;CommentText&gt;I have always praised RH for the care my husband has received but this time I have been very disappointed. When in hospital he is totally reliant on staff for care. He also now has early stage dementia. During his 10 day stay he was given gluten despite me telling them on 3 different occasions that he has coeliac  &amp;amp; this was even done by one of the SALT therapists. They lost his insulin for most of a day . He was hardly ever given hot drinks. No one apart from when he was in A&amp;amp;E &amp;amp; AMU ever told me what was going on even though I'm his wife &amp;amp; carer. On the day he came home I only knew because I asked &amp;amp; was told he was told he was medically fit the previous day but were waiting for a care package despite the fact I'd explained to 2 social workers &amp;amp; ot's that we didn't need it. On the same day his brother was told he'd be in for a few more days. So 2 different answers. I told one of the nurses that a bag full of clothes, a coat &amp;amp; 2 pairs of shoes in his locker were not his but when he arrived home at 22.40 he arrived home with them. So someone else will be going home without their belongings. And why on earth do you send someone who is vulnerable &amp;amp; also has dementia &amp;amp; had been in hospital with pneumonia home at this time on a freezing cold December evening. So my experience this time of RH is that no one listens to you, no one lets you know what is going on. And nursing staff do not even do basic care most of the time, giving correct food, medications specifically insulin at the right time, talking to patients when doing things for them, helping with shaving &amp;amp; teeth brushing when the person cannot do it themselves. But they seem to find time to eat cake, talk about where they went for their daughter's Birthday meal &amp;amp; sit at the desk laughing &amp;amp; joking &amp;amp; ignoring relatives when all they want is the care that should be given to their relative.&lt;/CommentText&gt;

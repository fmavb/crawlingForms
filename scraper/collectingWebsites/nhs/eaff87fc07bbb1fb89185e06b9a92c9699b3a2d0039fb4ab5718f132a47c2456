    &lt;Title&gt;Sunday night in A&amp;amp;amp;E&lt;/Title&gt;
    &lt;ScreenName&gt;Rachael Smith&lt;/ScreenName&gt;
    &lt;CommentText&gt;On the advice of an out of hours GP I attended A&amp;amp;amp;E. I won’t mention the lengthy waiting times, which were ridiculously long, but will focus on my other disappointing observations. The ANP left the room twice and didn’t lock the PC and I could see sensitive, confidential data. The ANP referred me for blood tests but warned it might take a while as there were “only two for everyone”. I was called in almost immediately and had two phlebotomists attend to me: one discarded the rubbish while the other took the bloods. In x-ray there were two radiographers: one stood behind me while the other took the x-ray. I have been x-rayed regularly for 34 years and I know it only needs one professional. A number of us were waiting in the ASU for some time and, when one patient asked when they might be seen, was told there was a shift change in progress and they would be seen after that. Despite the long wait, after the shift change, we were all called to see doctors in quick succession. I saw two doctors: one had a piece of paper in her hand with details of the patients waiting clearly written on it. I returned the next day for an ultrasound scan on the ASU, scheduled for 8.30am. At 8.40 a staff member entered the room and started setting up: I was called in at 9am. After the scan I waited until 10.30 and asked a staff member if I was likely to be seen soon as I had a GP appointment at 11am: I was told they couldn’t say and advised to cancel the GP appointment. Whilst in the ASU waiting area another patient was vaping. After a few minutes l was called to see the doctor, who was dismissive and actually said my test results were ok and I should “brush it under the carpet”. I made it to my GP appointment and was given helpful advice on what the problem is and how I should manage it.&lt;/CommentText&gt;
